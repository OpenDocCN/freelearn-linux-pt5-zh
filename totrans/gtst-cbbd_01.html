There are, however, a lot of boards available. With so many choices available, which board do you pick? Choosing the board to start working with can make a difference later on, so this chapter provides an introduction to the various boards and states the major differences between them. While the focus of this book does indeed lie on the Cubieboard family from Cubietech, it might still be prudent to give this chapter some attention for a potential second board. Additionally, this book does apply just as easily to the boards mentioned here.</p><p>In this first chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Why are there so many boards to choose from?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An overview of various boards</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Highlighting the most popular boards</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ideas regarding what additional hardware is required</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Wading through the forest of available chips and boards"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Wading through the forest of available chips and boards</h1></div></div></div><p>There are many chips<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/> and even more boards<a id="id1" class="indexterm"/> to choose from when going into ARM development. This chapter also provides a short introduction to various chips and compares them.</p><div class="section" title="A short overview of chips"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>A short overview of chips</h2></div></div></div><p>In the<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/> last few years, ARM-based <a id="id3" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Systems on Chips</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SoCs</strong></span>) have become immensely popular. Compared to the regular x86 Intel-based or AMD-based CPUs, they are much more energy efficient and still perform adequately. They also incorporate a lot of peripherals, such as a <span class="strong"><strong>Graphics Processor Unit</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>GPU</strong></span>), a <span class="strong"><strong>Video Accelerator</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>VPU</strong></span>), an<a id="id4" class="indexterm"/> audio controller, various <a id="id5" class="indexterm"/>storage controllers, and various buses (I2C and SPI), to name a few things. This immensely reduces the required components on a board. With the reduction in the required components, there are a few obvious advantages, such as reduction in the cost and, consequentially, a much easier design of boards. Thus, many companies with electronic engineers are able to design and manufacture these boards cheaply.</p><p>So, there are many boards; does that mean there are also many SoCs? Quite a few actually, but to keep<a id="id6" class="indexterm"/> the following<a id="id7" class="indexterm"/> list short, only the most popular ones are listed:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Allwinner's A-series</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Broadcom's BCM-series</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Freescale's i.MX-series</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">MediaTek's MT-series</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Rockchip's RK-series</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Samsung's Exynos-series</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">NVIDIA's Tegra-series</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Texas Instruments' AM-series and OMAP-series</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Qualcomm's APQ-series and MSM-series</li></ul></div><p>While many of the potential chips are interesting, Allwinner's A-series<a id="id8" class="indexterm"/> of SoCs<a id="id9" class="indexterm"/> will be the focus of this<a id="id10" class="indexterm"/> book. Due to their <a id="id11" class="indexterm"/>low price and decent availability, quite a <a id="id12" class="indexterm"/>few <a id="id13" class="indexterm"/>companies design development boards around<a id="id14" class="indexterm"/> these chips and sell them at a low cost. Additionally, the A-series is presently the most open source friendly series of chips available. There is a fully open source bootloader, and nearly all the hardware is supported by open source drivers. Among the A-series of chips, there are a few choices. The following is a list of the most common and most interesting devices:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>A10</strong></span>: This<a id="id15" class="indexterm"/> is the first chip of the A-series and the best supported <a id="id16" class="indexterm"/>one as it has been around for a long time. It is able to communicate with the outside world over I2C, SPI, MMC, NAND, digital and analog video out, analog audio out, SPDIF, I2S, Ethernet MAC, USB, SATA, and HDMI. This chip initially targeted everything, such as phones, tablets, set-top boxes, and mini PC sticks. For its GPU, it features the MALI-400.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>A10S</strong></span>: This <a id="id17" class="indexterm"/>chip followed the A10; it focused mainly on the PC <a id="id18" class="indexterm"/>stick market and left out several parts, such as SATA and analog video in/out, and it has no LCD interface. These parts were left out to reduce the cost of the chip, making it interesting for cheap TV sticks.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>A13</strong></span>: This <a id="id19" class="indexterm"/>chip<a id="id20" class="indexterm"/> was introduced more or less simultaneously with the A10S for primary use in tablets. It lacked SATA, Ethernet MAC, and also HDMI, which reduced the chip's cost even more.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>A20</strong></span>: This <a id="id21" class="indexterm"/>chip was introduced way after the others, and even <a id="id22" class="indexterm"/>was pin-compatible to the A10 with the intend to replace it. As the name hints, the A20 is a dual-core variant of the A10. The ARM cores are slightly different; Cortex-A7 has been used in the A10 instead of Cortex-A8 used previously.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>A23</strong></span>: This <a id="id23" class="indexterm"/>chip was introduced after the A31 and A31S and is reasonably <a id="id24" class="indexterm"/>similar to the A31 in its design. It features a dual-core Cortex-A7 design and is intended to replace the A13. It is mainly intended to be used in tablets.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>A31</strong></span>: This<a id="id25" class="indexterm"/> chip features four Cortex-A7 cores and generally <a id="id26" class="indexterm"/>has all the connections that the A10 has. It is, however, not popular within the community because it features a PowerVR GPU that, until now, has seen no community support at all. Additionally, there are no development boards commonly available for this chip.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>A31S</strong></span>: This <a id="id27" class="indexterm"/>chip was released slightly after the A31 to solve some <a id="id28" class="indexterm"/>issues with the A31. There are no common development boards available.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Choosing the right development board"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>Choosing the right development board</h2></div></div></div><p>Allwinner's A-series <a id="id29" class="indexterm"/>of SoCs was produced and sold so cheaply that many companies used these chips in their products, such as tablets, set-top boxes, and eventually, development boards. Before the availability of development boards, people worked on and with tablets and set-top boxes. The most common and popular boards are from Cubietech and Olimex, in part because both companies handed out development boards to community developers for free.</p><div class="section" title="Olimex"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>Olimex</h3></div></div></div><p>Olimex <a id="id30" class="indexterm"/>has <a id="id31" class="indexterm"/>released a fair amount of different development boards and peripherals. A lot of its boards are open source hardware with schematics and layout files available, and Olimex is also very open source friendly. You can see the Olimex board in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1572OS_01_01.jpg" alt="Olimex"/></div><p>Olimex offers <a id="id32" class="indexterm"/>the <a id="id33" class="indexterm"/>A10-OLinuXino-LIME, an A10-based micro board that is marketed to compete with the famous Raspberry Pi price-wise. Due to its small size, it uses less standard 1.27 mm pitch headers for the pins, but it has nearly all of these pins exposed for use.</p><p>You can see the A10-OLinuXino-LIME board in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1572OS_01_02.jpg" alt="Olimex"/></div><p>The Olimex OLinuXino series<a id="id34" class="indexterm"/> of boards is available in the A10, A13, and A20 flavors and has more standard 2.54 mm pitch headers that are compatible with the old IDE and serial connectors. Olimex has various sensors, displays, and other peripherals that are also compatible with these headers.</p><p>Olimex recently announced that it will be releasing a <a id="id35" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>System on a Module</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SoM</strong></span>). It is identical in concept to the Itead board, which will be mentioned in a later section.</p></div><div class="section" title="Cubietech"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec02"/>Cubietech</h3></div></div></div><p>Cubietech <a id="id36" class="indexterm"/>was<a id="id37" class="indexterm"/> formed by previous Allwinner employees and was one of the first development boards available using the Allwinner SoC. While it is not open source hardware, it does offer the schematics for download. Cubietech<a id="id38" class="indexterm"/> released three boards: the <a id="id39" class="indexterm"/>Cubieboard1, the Cubieboard2, and the Cubieboard3—also <a id="id40" class="indexterm"/>known as <a id="id41" class="indexterm"/>the Cubietruck. Interfacing with these boards can be quite tricky as they use 2 mm pitch headers that might be hard to find in Europe or America. You can see the Cubietech board in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1572OS_01_03.jpg" alt="Cubietech"/></div><p>Cubieboard1 and Cubieboard2 use <a id="id42" class="indexterm"/>identical boards; the only difference is that A20 is used instead of A10 in Cubieboard2. These boards only have a subset of the pins exposed. You can see the Cubietruck board in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1572OS_01_04.jpg" alt="Cubietech"/></div><p>Cubietruck is quite different but is a well-designed A20 board. It features everything that the previous boards <a id="id43" class="indexterm"/>offer, along with Gigabit Ethernet, VGA, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and an optical audio out. This does come at a cost as there are fewer pins to keep the size reasonably small. Compared to Raspberry Pi or LIME, it is almost double the size.</p></div><div class="section" title="Lemaker"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec03"/>Lemaker</h3></div></div></div><p>Lemaker <a id="id44" class="indexterm"/>made a smart design choice when releasing<a id="id45" class="indexterm"/> its Banana Pi board. It is an Allwinner A20-based board but uses the same board size and connector placement as Raspberry Pi, hence the name Banana Pi. Because of this, many of those Raspberry Pi cases could fit the Banana Pi and even shields will fit it. Software-wise, it is quite different and does not work when using Raspberry Pi image files. Nevertheless, it features composite video out, stereo audio out, HDMI out Gigabit Ethernet, two USB ports, one USB OtG port, CSI out and LVDS out, and a handful of pins. Also available are a LiPo battery connector, a SATA connector, and two buttons, but those might not be accessible on a lot of standard cases. See the <a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>following <a id="id47" class="indexterm"/>image for the topside of the Banana Pi:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1572OS_01_05.jpg" alt="Lemaker"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Itead and Olimex"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec04"/>Itead and Olimex</h3></div></div></div><p>Itead and Olimex<a id="id48" class="indexterm"/> both <a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>offer interesting boards, which are worth mentioning separately. The Iteaduino Plus and the Olimex A20-SoM are quite interesting concepts; the computing module, which is a board with the SoC, memory, and flash, which are plugin modules, and a separate baseboard. Both of them sell a very complete baseboard as open source hardware, but anybody can design their own baseboard and buy the computing module. You can see the following board by Itead:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1572OS_01_06.jpg" alt="Itead and Olimex"/></div><p>Refer to the <a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>following board by Olimex:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1572OS_01_07.jpg" alt="Itead and Olimex"/></div></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Additional hardware"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>Additional hardware</h1></div></div></div><p>While a<a id="id51" class="indexterm"/> development board is a key ingredient, there are several other items that are also required. A power supply, for example, is not always supplied and does have some considerations. Also, additional hardware is required for the initial communication and to debug.</p><div class="section" title="Serially interfacing with the board"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Serially interfacing with the board</h2></div></div></div><p>With headless <a id="id52" class="indexterm"/>systems such as these, things don't always just work. Sometimes, debugging at a lower level is required. This is also certainly true with development boards such as these. An error occurs, and there's no output; what could have possibly gone wrong? So spending hours on trial and error can be avoided; the old and trusty serial port exists on many types of hardware. With Allwinner's SoCs, they are implemented in two ways.</p><div class="section" title="Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec05"/>Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter</h3></div></div></div><p>On all of<a id="id53" class="indexterm"/> the developer boards <a id="id54" class="indexterm"/>discussed throughout this book, there are dedicated pins to connect to the serial port of the chip. If the PC that is used to connect to the developer board has such a serial port, be wary of how this is connected. While both speak the same protocol, they operate at different voltages to do this; thus, a level translator is required at the least. Most PCs are without a serial port these days anyway and have to rely on a USB to <span class="strong"><strong>universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>UART</strong></span>) adapter. When getting a <a id="id55" class="indexterm"/>USB to UART adapter, it is important that they are 3.3V TTL. Cubieboards are usually shipped with a USB to UART adapter, as shown in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1572OS_01_08.jpg" alt="Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter"/></div></div><div class="section" title="The microSD adapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec06"/>The microSD adapter</h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes, the <a id="id56" class="indexterm"/>UART simply isn't available<a id="id57" class="indexterm"/> for use as in the case of most tablets. In such cases, a second UART is made available through the microSD card slot. A specific adapter is required to connect to the previously mentioned UART. In the following image, a microSD to UART adapter can be seen (this specific variant also has the ability to grant access to the JTAG pins):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1572OS_01_09.jpg" alt="The microSD adapter"/></div></div><div class="section" title="The microSD card"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec07"/>The microSD card</h3></div></div></div><p>Usually, a <a id="id58" class="indexterm"/>microSD card is the boot medium for these <a id="id59" class="indexterm"/>boards. It can be thought of as a bootable CD or USB drive used on a PC. When creating microSD cards to be used as a medium, it is advisable to use a class 10 or faster microSD.</p></div><div class="section" title="Power supply"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec08"/>Power supply</h3></div></div></div><p>Believe it<a id="id60" class="indexterm"/> or not, but most developer boards actually come without a power supply; this is usually due to the following reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Without the power supply, developer boards do not have to pass the FCC regulations</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Importing a power supply might require certain local certification and might be forbidden</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It can give rise to the complexity of the developer not knowing which power supply needs to be sent to a country</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It has reduced the cost, as not bundling the power supply has brought about a reduction in the cost</li></ul></div><p>Most boards <a id="id61" class="indexterm"/>will take 5 volts for their input, but 700 milliamp of current is the least that they should supply when not using anything power hungry, such as an HDD or an LCD. If extra peripherals are attached, this requirement also goes up. A proper 5-volt, 2-amp power supply will be enough to power a board under full load with an LCD attached. Depending on the power requirements of the hard drive, even that should be able to work quite nicely. When in doubt, always check the power drain or power supply stability to exclude that from causing strange issues. Cheaply made power supplies available from various shops are often overrated and thus they might not supply the required current; however, they might not supply the required current and cause everything to run unstably.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>After working your way through this chapter, you should now have an idea of the available, popular development boards, and which one might be a good choice for you. Finally, it should be noted that extra hardware is sometimes required or, at least, extremely helpful to work with these boards.</p><p>The next chapter will take this newly acquired hardware and explain how you can interact with it. If the selected board comes with preinstalled software, booting it will be covered as well.</p></div></body></html>
