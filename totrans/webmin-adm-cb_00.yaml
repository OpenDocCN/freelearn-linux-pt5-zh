    practical recipes for solving real-world system administration tasks through a
    convenient tool called Webmin.

- en: Running an internet-connected private server used to be expensive and available
    mainly to larger companies who either hired professional sysadmins or outsourced
    administration. Thanks to the wide adoption of virtualization software, efficient
    private servers have now become available to anyone with the right skills. Whether
    you're a developer trying to optimize the performance of your web application
    or you're a startup looking to implement new software architecture for your systems,
    chances are you'll need to configure and run your own servers.

- en: Few things are as valuable as having the right tools for a job, and Webmin is
    a great addition to your toolbox. It allows you to get your server up and running
    quickly, monitor its state, and be notified by e-mail when the server needs your
    attention. Webmin simplifies many system administration tasks by abstracting away
    the complexity of the system command and configuration file syntax, replacing
    them with a friendly graphical web interface.

- en: Webmin is very lightweight for a GUI application because it doesn't require
    a desktop environment to be running on your system. You also don't need complex
    desktop sharing solutions to use it. Since it is a web application, all you need
    to make full use of Webmin is a browser. Its web nature also makes Webmin resilient
    to slow or unstable Internet connections. Overall, it's a great tool for administering
    servers remotely.

    We'll go through the process of setting up a server from a fresh installation
    to a full-fledged web application server that runs Apache, a database management
    system and e-mail software. We'll cover how to set up web applications written
    in a range of scripting languages. We'll also set up Webmin to monitor your system
    and alert you about potential problems.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Setting Up Your System"), *Setting Up Your
    System*, covers the first steps that will get your Webmin up and running. In this
    chapter, we will discuss how to set up Webmin itself, how to monitor what it does,
    and how to undo changes made through Webmin. The chapter also covers the process
    of installing other software on your system, selecting which software gets started
    at boot time, and how to inspect what installation packages put on your system.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. User Management"), *User Management*, deals
    with topics related to the users of your system. The chapter discusses adding
    and editing system users or groups, allowing these users access to Webmin. We''ll
    also demonstrate how Webmin can be used to export a list of all users from one
    server and import their accounts into another system. We end the chapter by introducing
    Usermin, the user-facing companion of Webmin.'

    deals with basic system security, including locking down your system with a firewall
    and connecting to system services over encrypted tunnels. We''ll go through a
    checklist of security precautions that you should take before putting your server
    on the Internet.'

    System*, demonstrates how Webmin can be used to execute commands on your system
    remotely through a web browser. In this chapter, we''ll also discuss how to set
    up cron jobs to execute commands regularly, delaying command execution until a
    chosen time, and setting up a web panel for easy access to tasks you need to run
    occasionally.'

    System*, discusses how Webmin can be used to watch over your system and even other
    servers. We''ll demonstrate how Webmin can be set up to handle a situation when
    services on your machine crash—it can send you e-mail alerts or try to restart
    the services automatically. In this chapter, we''ll also discuss how to analyze
    the state of your system through log files and configure log rotation routines.'

- en: Throughout this book, we'll be dealing with system administration, which means
    you'll need a system to administer. You will get the most out of this book if
    you rent a **Virtual Private Server** (**VPS**) from a hosting provider and set
    it up with a fresh installation of Linux (preferably Debian or CentOS). VPS servers
    are inexpensive these days, with prices starting at $5/month. If you prefer to
    experiment locally, you can set up a virtual machine inside the free VirtualBox
    platform. You should also configure a terminal emulator or SSH client through
    which you can access your server to execute commands and edit files.

    Many of these recipes will also work on other Unixes (such as BSD-based FreeBSD
    or OS X), but Webmin''s support for these platforms may be limited in places.

    administrative privileges on your system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main system administrator on Unix-like operating systems such as Linux is
    often called **root**. On some systems you can log in as this super user. When
    this is the case, you can do anything and everything on the system. This makes
    potential mistakes more dangerous. Other systems (such as Ubuntu) won't allow
    you to log in as root, so you will need to log in as a regular user with super
    user (**sudo**) privileges.

    file. Throughout this book, we will mark commands that require administrative

    break things. The recipes in this book have been tested, but every system is different
    and we can't guarantee that they will always work as expected. Before you implement
    these solutions on your production systems, you should test them in a secondary
    machine. Make sure you know what you're doing before changing the configuration
    of your production systems.

    be familiar with all of its details. If you're a novice administrator, this book
    is a good starting off point; if you're a professional, this book will highlight
