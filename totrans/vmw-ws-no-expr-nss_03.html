In some aspects, there are important differences. In this chapter, you'll learn about these differences that can sometimes make working with virtual machines a bit of a challenge. In this chapter, you'll also learn how to deal with the various particularities of working in a virtual environment.</p><div class="section" title="Performing common tasks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec19"/>Performing common tasks</h1></div></div></div><p>Even the most common tasks<a id="id87" class="indexterm"/> can be different in a virtual machine. It starts with the virtual machine window itself. Once you're on it, the mouse cursor is captured. That means you'll need to apply a special trick to get back to the host operating system. The common way to do this is by pressing <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> at the same time. But what if in the virtual operating system, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> keys sequence has a specific meaning? If that's the case, you'll need to define the hot keys that are used in your virtual environment. To do this, apply the following procedure:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">From the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> menu, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> option.</li><li class="listitem">In the bar on the left of the screen, select <span class="strong"><strong>Hot Keys</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">You'll now see the interface that is shown in the following screenshot. By default, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> keys are used as the virtual machine hotkeys, and specific manipulations are assigned to these hotkeys.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the hotkeys that you want to be redefined. For instance, if you want to use <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="strong"><strong>Win</strong></span> as the default hotkeys, click on these buttons:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9182EN_03_01.jpg" alt="Performing common tasks"/><div class="caption"><p>Assigning the hotkeys that you want to use</p></div></div></li></ol></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>Don't forget to deselect the hotkeys that you don't want to use anymore; you probably don't want to use key sequences such as <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Shift</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> + <span class="strong"><strong>Win</strong></span> all at the same time!</p></div></div><p>Now that you have<a id="id88" class="indexterm"/> assigned the hotkeys that make sense to you, you can use them for some of the most common actions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Use the hotkeys to release control from the current machine</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Use the hotkeys + <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> to enter or leave the fullscreen mode</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Use hotkeys + left arrow or right arrow to switch to the previous or the next virtual machine</li></ul></div><p>Another common task is about <span class="strong"><strong>Updates</strong></span>. You can access this feature from the <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> menu as well. By default, VMware Workstation will check for updates on startup, and it will automatically update software components that you're using as well. That's just fine and there is no reason why you would want to change that.</p><p>A very useful update option that is not enabled by default is the update of VMware Tools. By default, the VMware Tools that are installed in a virtual machine are never updated. If you want the best possible performance for your virtual machine, it does make sense to update VMware Tools automatically as well. You should realize that using the latest version of VMware Tools <a id="id89" class="indexterm"/>ensures the best possible performance, especially on I/O-drivers. To do this select the <span class="strong"><strong>Updates</strong></span> option from the <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> tab and select <span class="strong"><strong>Automatically update VMware Tools on a virtual machine</strong></span>.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Working with hardware"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec20"/>Working with hardware</h1></div></div></div><p>Each virtual machine <a id="id90" class="indexterm"/>has hardware assigned. You have selected the hardware that you want to use while creating the virtual machine. On an installed virtual machine, you will frequently modify hardware settings as well. On some occasions, it will be necessary to assign a new virtual hardware but common tasks such as booting from a CD-ROM requires some specific action as well.</p><div class="section" title="Booting your virtual machine from a CD-ROM"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec13"/>Booting your virtual machine from a CD-ROM</h2></div></div></div><p>There are <a id="id91" class="indexterm"/>different ways to boot a virtual machine. You <a id="id92" class="indexterm"/>can either use a physical CD-ROM or a DVD disk or as an alternative, you can boot from an ISO file. Using ISO files is useful, as you don't have to make sure the physical disk is present for all operations you want to perform.</p><p>To tell your virtual machine where it needs to boot from, boot into <span class="strong"><strong>BIOS</strong></span> to change the boot order. To enter the <span class="strong"><strong>BIOS</strong></span> setup for the guest operating system, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>VM</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Power</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Power On to BIOS</strong></span>.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note090"/>Note</h3><p>To make the boot delay a bit longer, you can add the following to the VMX file of your virtual machine: <code class="literal">bios.bootDelay = 1000</code>. This will give you 3 seconds of time to interfere with the boot process.</p></div></div><p>Booting a virtual machine from a CD-ROM can be a real challenge. This is because you'll have a minimal amount of time to press the right key to boot from an optical disk while the virtual machine is booting, and also you need to make sure that you are connected to the right virtual CD-ROM. In the following procedure, you can read how it works:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Restart your virtual machine.</li><li class="listitem">When you see the virtual machine <span class="strong"><strong>BIOS</strong></span> loading, immediately click on the virtual machine window and press the <span class="emphasis"><em>Esc</em></span> key. This will show the <span class="strong"><strong>BIOS</strong></span> menu (see the following screenshot):<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9182EN_03_02.jpg" alt="Booting your virtual machine from a CD-ROM"/><div class="caption"><p>The virtual machine's BIOS boot menu</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">Don't select <a id="id93" class="indexterm"/>CD-ROM from the virtual <a id="id94" class="indexterm"/>machine <span class="strong"><strong>BIOS</strong></span> yet but open the <span class="strong"><strong>VM</strong></span> menu, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Removable Devices</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>CD/DVD</strong></span>, and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span>. This opens the virtual machine's hardware settings window with <span class="strong"><strong>CD/DVD</strong></span> selected. Make sure that you've selected either the correct physical drive that contains the CD-ROM disk that you want to use or use an image file to select an ISO image file.<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9182EN_03_03.jpg" alt="Booting your virtual machine from a CD-ROM"/><div class="caption"><p>Selecting the CD-ROM disk you want to use</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">Click on <a id="id95" class="indexterm"/><span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> to save the selected <a id="id96" class="indexterm"/>optical disk.</li><li class="listitem">Get back to <span class="strong"><strong>BIOS Boot Menu</strong></span> of your virtual machine and select <span class="strong"><strong>CD-ROM Drive</strong></span>. The virtual machine will now boot from the CD-ROM disk.</li></ol></div></div><div class="section" title="Modifying virtual hardware"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec14"/>Modifying virtual hardware</h2></div></div></div><p>When you created your <a id="id97" class="indexterm"/>virtual machine, you also selected the hardware that you want to use. One of the benefits of working with virtual machines is that it is easy to change the hardware settings later if needed. To access the current hardware settings, right-click on <span class="strong"><strong>virtual machine</strong></span> and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> option. From here, you can see all the hardware that is currently selected and change the hardware assignments as well. If VMware Tools are installed, some setting will even be applied directly to the virtual machine without the need to reboot it.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9182EN_03_04.jpg" alt="Modifying virtual hardware"/><div class="caption"><p>Changing the virtual machine's hardware settings</p></div></div><p>While adding virtual<a id="id98" class="indexterm"/> hardware, in most cases, you can be very specific about the properties of the hardware that is added. In the following procedure, you'll read how to add a disk and configure some advanced disk properties. Especially when setting up test environments that need to mirror the production environment, it can be important to specify properties such as the SCSI ID or disk type.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Right-click on the virtual machine to which you want to add a new disk and open the <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> menu item. In this example, I'll add a disk to a Linux VM.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> and from the <span class="strong"><strong>Hardware Type</strong></span> window, select <span class="strong"><strong>Hard Disk</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">Select <span class="strong"><strong>Create a new virtual disk</strong></span> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">At this point, you can specify whether you want the disk to be an independent disk or not. This is an important choice with regard to snapshots; independent disks are not affected by snapshots (discussed in detail in <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Cloning and Snapshots">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Cloning and Snapshots</em></span>, of this book). When you make a snapshot of a disk, the disk needs to be stopped for a short moment. For some services (such as databases), you really don't want a disk to be stopped even if it is just for a short moment. In those cases, it makes sense to configure the disk as an independent disk, but be aware that you won't be able to create a snapshot of such a disk.</li><li class="listitem">When creating an independent disk, you need to specify how changes are handled. The default behavior is to write them directly to the disk. Another option is to make the changes nonpersistent, which means that you will lose them if you power off the virtual machine.</li><li class="listitem">After specifying which type of disk you want to use, you need to configure the disk capacity. An important part of the configuration is whether or not you want to allocate all disk space now. By default, thin provisioning is used, which means that the disk space is only allocated at the moment when it is actually needed. Thin provisioning means that the available disk space on the host operating system is used as efficiently as possible but there is a performance penalty. If the available disk space on the host is not important, and performance is, you had better select the <span class="strong"><strong>Allocate all disk space now</strong></span> option. With this option, you will make sure that all disk space is reserved, which offers best performance for your VM. You also need to specify whether you want the disk to be created as a single file or as multiple files. Using multiple files makes it easier to move a virtual machine to another computer, especially if the <code class="literal">FAT32</code> file system is used on that computer, which has a limited maximal file size. On large disks, you will however pay a performance price when working with multiple files.</li><li class="listitem">After specifying <a id="id99" class="indexterm"/>the name of the disk file, the file is created and written to the disk. After creating it, you can click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Advanced</strong></span> button to specify some of its properties. In some cases, the order in which the disk is presented to the virtual machine can be important. You can specify this order by selecting the <span class="strong"><strong>SCSI</strong></span> ID. If you want a disk to be presented as the first disk in the virtual operating system (which ensures that it is the bootable device), make sure to configure it as <code class="literal">SCSI 0:0</code> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>.<div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip10"/>Tip</h3><p>Changing the order in which disks are presented can have the result that the virtual machine won't boot anymore. Make sure that you know what you're doing before selecting this option.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">After clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>OK,</strong></span> the new hardware settings are written to the virtual machine. This doesn't activate the new hardware immediately though. On Linux, after adding a SCSI disk, you can tell Linux to reread its disks, which will make the new device available immediately. After adding the new disk as the user root, use the following command to make the new disk available without having to<a id="id100" class="indexterm"/> reboot the VM:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>echo "- - -" &gt; /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/scan</strong></span>

<div class="section" title="Working with shared folders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec21"/>Working with shared folders</h1></div></div></div><p>A very useful feature in <a id="id101" class="indexterm"/>VMware Workstation is shared folders. Using shared folders allows you to easily share files between the host operating system and VMware Workstation. Using shared folders allows you to get access to a shared folder on the host computer in the virtual machine.</p><p>To work with shared folders, you need to enable them in the virtual machine. Once enabled, you can access them from the virtual machine's operating system. In the following procedure, you can read how it works:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Working with shared folders starts on the virtual machine where you want to use it. So make sure that the virtual machine where you want to use it is started.</li><li class="listitem">Once the virtual machine is started, select <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> from the <span class="strong"><strong>VM</strong></span> menu and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span> tab. From this tab, select the <span class="strong"><strong>Shared Folders</strong></span> item.<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9182EN_03_05.jpg" alt="Working with shared folders"/><div class="caption"><p>Enabling shared folders on the virtual machine</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">To enable shared folders, you can select <span class="strong"><strong>Always enabled</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Enabled until next power off or suspend</strong></span>. If you're just looking for an easy way to exchange files, the latter method works best. If you want the files on the shared folder to be always accessible, select <span class="strong"><strong>Always enabled</strong></span>. If you're enabling shared folders for Windows guests, you can indicate that you want to see the shared folder as a network drive in Windows guests.</li><li class="listitem">After specifying how you want to use shared folders, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> to start the <span class="strong"><strong>Shared Folder</strong></span> wizard. In the first step of this wizard, you'll need to select a path on the host computer. Use the <span class="strong"><strong>Browse</strong></span> button to select the appropriate path and give it a name.</li><li class="listitem">Next, you'll specify how to share this folder. Click on <span class="strong"><strong>Enable this share</strong></span> for access in full read/write mode, or <span class="strong"><strong>Read-only</strong></span> if you just want to allow files to be read. Next click on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>. The shared folder will now be available in the virtual machine.</li><li class="listitem">To access a<a id="id102" class="indexterm"/> shared folder from a Linux virtual machine, go to the <code class="literal">/mnt/hgfs</code> directory.

<div class="section" title="Setting virtual machine options"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec22"/>Setting virtual machine options</h1></div></div></div><p>You've just worked with the <a id="id103" class="indexterm"/>virtual machine options item to enable shared folders. There are some other settings that you can select from this tab. Some of the most interesting options are discussed in this section.</p><div class="section" title="Automatic snapshots"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec15"/>Automatic snapshots</h2></div></div></div><p>When working with a virtual <a id="id104" class="indexterm"/>machine, you can have a <a id="id105" class="indexterm"/>snapshot created automatically. A snapshot is like a picture of the current state of a virtual machine that allows you to go back to that specific state in an easy way. As an additional protection for virtual machines, you can have snapshots created automatically when powering off. However, using snapshots may be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing; they do use disk space and by using snapshots, you risk running out of available disk space. Also, performance will worsen if there are snapshots for your virtual machines.</p><p>To enable the automatic snapshot feature, access the <span class="strong"><strong>Snapshots</strong></span> menu option and select between the following when powering off the options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Just power off</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Revert to snapshot</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Take a new snapshot</strong></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Ask me</strong></span></li></ul></div><p>Notice that the <span class="strong"><strong>Revert to snapshot</strong></span> option is a potentially dangerous option; it will reset your virtual machine to the state it was in when the last snapshot was created, and you will lose all the changes that you've made since.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>AutoProtect</strong></span><a id="id106" class="indexterm"/> feature that you can also find in the virtual machine's <a id="id107" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span> menu is related to snapshots. You can use this feature to automatically create snapshots according to the parameters that you've specified. This is a useful feature that always allows you to get back to a reasonably recent state of the virtual machine.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9182EN_03_06.jpg" alt="Automatic snapshots"/><div class="caption"><p>When using AutoProtect, you're sure that you can always revert to a recent state of the virtual machine</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Time synchronization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec16"/>Time synchronization</h2></div></div></div><p>In virtualized<a id="id108" class="indexterm"/> environments, time <a id="id109" class="indexterm"/>keeping may be a problem. This is because time is based on CPU ticks, and in a VMware Workstation virtual environment, virtual machines don't use CPU ticks the way normal computers do. Therefore, you might see huge time drifting if you don't take the appropriate measures. At the other end, time synchronization is essential because many services rely on the appropriate time.</p><p>On the VMware Tools menu option, you'll find an interesting option as well. This option specifies whether you want to use time synchronization or not. By default, the virtual machine doesn't synchronize time with the host. Because of virtual machine's inherent features, this may lead to a time that significantly differs from the real time. To avoid issues, it is a good idea to have the virtual machine synchronize time with the host and to configure NTP time synchronization on the host, which ensures that a reliable time is used on the host as well.</p></div><div class="section" title="VNC connections"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec17"/>VNC connections</h2></div></div></div><p>To access a virtual machine, you can <a id="id110" class="indexterm"/>configure remote access within the <a id="id111" class="indexterm"/>Virtual Machine itself. If, however, you're looking for a more standard method of enabling remote access which works for all virtual machines, no matter which operating system you're using, VNC connections is an interesting option. With VNC, you'll share access from the VMware Workstation host to the entire virtual machine screen. The benefit of this approach is that you can use it to access all virtual machines no matter what operating system is running inside. There is an inconvenience to using VNC though; data that is sent over a VNC connection is not encrypted by default. This means you should only use it to access virtual machines that are on a network connection which you trust completely.</p><p>To enable a VNC access to virtual machines, you need to select the Enable VNC connections option on each virtual machine (VM) where you want to use it. Next, you'll need to specify a VNC Port. Every VNC connection will use its own port, so you might end up with one VNC process that is listening on several ports on your host and that is fine. It's also a very good idea to protect each VNC session with a password. If you don't use a password, anyone can just connect to the active sessions on the virtual machine and that is a huge threat to security!</p><p>After setting up VNC for virtual machines, you'll need to make sure that you have a VNC client on the remote computer. Different VNC clients are available for free, and you can find one on, for instance, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.realvnc.com">www.realvnc.com</a>.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Securing virtual machines"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec23"/>Securing virtual machines</h1></div></div></div><p>While using VNC <a id="id112" class="indexterm"/>means that you'll weaken security on the virtual machines, you can also choose to add some extra protection. You'll find related options on the <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span> tab of each virtual machine (navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>VM</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span>). The name of the related option is <span class="strong"><strong>Access Control</strong></span>, and you can use it to set different kinds of protection.</p><p>First, you can encrypt the virtual machine. This process is equivalent to the encryption of an entire hard disk and if you use it, the virtual machine's disk file won't be accessible without entering the appropriate password. Using this option is recommended if you want to make sure that you can trust the virtual machine in an environment where you cannot be sure whether you can trust the host on which it's running. To enable encryption on a virtual machine, you must first shut down the virtual machine before starting the encryption process. Be aware that it may take a long time for the encryption process to complete, depending on the size of the hard disk where you're applying it to.</p><p>After encrypting a virtual machine, you can either remove the encryption or change the encryption password. To do this, first make sure that the virtual machine is powered off; you'll now see the <span class="strong"><strong>Change Password</strong></span> option and the <span class="strong"><strong>Remove Encryption</strong></span> option under <span class="strong"><strong>Access Control</strong></span>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9182EN_03_07.jpg" alt="Securing virtual machines"/><div class="caption"><p>Use encryption if you want to prevent unauthorized access to the virtual machine</p></div></div><p>On using <span class="strong"><strong>Encryption</strong></span>, just<a id="id113" class="indexterm"/> the contents of the virtual machine are encrypted. Users will still be allowed to change the virtual machine's configuration. If you want to prevent this, you should use restrictions as well. After selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Enable restrictions</strong></span>, each user who wants to change the configuration of a virtual machine must first enter <span class="strong"><strong>Restrictions password</strong></span>.</p><p>As related options, you can also enforce that the encryption password must be used after moving it. This is a good approach to ensure the security of the passwords that you're using; a password loses its strength if it's used on multiple locations. Also from the <span class="strong"><strong>Access Control</strong></span> tab, you can find an option to disallow USB keys to connect to the virtual machine. By applying all of these options, you'll be able to add a reasonable level of security to your virtual machines.</p></div>
