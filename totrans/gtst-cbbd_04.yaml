    via an image is certainly useful, but limitations arise quickly. What if an installation
    to an SSD is desired? Or what about having a very minimal installation for use
    as a server? Surely no heavy GUI is needed for this? All these questions will

    installation medium. A SATA SSD will be used, but a regular SATA disk can be equally
    used given that enough electrical power is available to power the drive; a power
    adapter with at least 2 amperes is required in such a case. Alternatively, a second
    microSD card can be used in a microSD-to-USB adapter.

    card to boot, as the SoC cannot boot from a SATA drive directly. Technically,
    the onboard NAND flash or an onboard SPI flash could be used for this instead,
    but SPI flash-enabled Cubieboards are hard to find, and working with NAND requires
    a very old u-boot, which lacks a lot of new features. In this chapter, the microSD
    card created in the previous chapter will be repurposed and used to accomplish
    all these tasks.

    To cut a long story short, it is basically Debian, and as a result, it does not
    hugely matter which distribution is used for installation, be it Debian or Ubuntu.
    So when talking about installing Ubuntu or Debian, the same thing is really being

    list of mirrors can be obtained for Debian at [http://www.debian.org/mirror/list-full](http://www.debian.org/mirror/list-full),
    but for Ubuntu, there is no official list of mirrors. However, using the country
    code in the URL can result in a mirror, for example, in the Netherlands, [http://nl.ports.ubuntu.com](http://nl.ports.ubuntu.com)
    is a valid mirror. Using a mirror has the obvious advantage that the download
    will proceed much faster.

    server on the network from where all the computers get their current time. Every
    system queries this server via `time.example.com`. Even if there's no Internet
    connectivity and no DNS service available, to ensure the time server is always
    able to be looked up, an entry to the hosts file can be added. With `192.168.0.15`

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both Debian and Ubuntu rely heavily on apt for their software needs. Apt is
    a suite of commands that allows the installation of new software packages or keeping
    the existing ones up to date. Apt works closely together with dpkg although a
    regular user will probably never invoke dpkg directly. Apt is responsible for
    downloading a requested piece of software, checking what its dependencies are,
    and telling dpkg to install them. It is the Swiss army knife of package management
    under Debian and Ubuntu. It was the command-line AppStore before AppStores even
    existed.

- en: Apt does not require a whole lot of configuring. What apt does need is a list
    of places where it can check and download software from. The Debian and Ubuntu
    defaults might not offer everything of interest. The file responsible for apt's
    configuration is `sources.list` at `/etc/apt/sources.list`, and if you are logged
    in as a regular user, it requires `sudo` to grant the user additional privileges
    to edit the file. In the following example, the non-free component and the security
    repository will be added to the main component. Note that the various sources
    in the `sources.list` file will vary between various suites or derivatives, such
    as Ubuntu.

    the list of applications that will be the `update` parameter passed. Again, if

    packages. Especially in combination with the `grep` command, these two can be
    helpful to find what is needed, as shown in the following screenshot. The `grep

    of writing this book, the `apt-file` tool is not yet included in the current stable

- en: The tasks available via `tasksel` appear to be rather limited. Instead, it is
    probably easier to use metapackages. Metapackages are, in effect, not that much
    different from tasks; in fact, they very well might be the same in the background.
    A metapackage is not really a package that installs anything, rather it is a list
    of packages or a collection of packages that get installed from it. For example,
    `xfce4` is a metapackage for Debian, which will install all the packages required
    for the `xfce4` desktop environment and will also install software that the package
    maintainers thought would make sense to have for a full-fledged desktop environment,
    such as a file manager.

    In fact, the following command will show you how to install multiple packages

    but will yield a usable `xfcef4` desktop, as if it were installed from a CD, for
    example. One could even argue that an installation CD would do just that, as shown

    console. This yields an almost usable desktop environment. Almost means here that
    certain things with permissions are missing. A user is not allowed to shut down
    the machine by default, for example.

    use of a login manager; xfce4, however, does not come with one, but that is okay.
    There are plenty of login managers to choose from. GNOME comes with `gdm`, but
    going with a lightweight login manager that matches Xfce4 as a lightweight desktop
    manager, LightDM should be a good candidate. Installing the `lightdm` package
    should require no extra instructions. Rebooting the Cubieboard now will yield
    an active login window, which upon login, wraps up this chapter.
