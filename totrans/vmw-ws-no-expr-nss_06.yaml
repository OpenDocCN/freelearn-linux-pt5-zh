    accessible from a distance. Even if you're using VMware Workstation on your own
    computer, there are different ways in which you can accomplish this. In this chapter,
    you'll read how to use VNC, the VMware web service, and VNC on individual machines
    to access virtual machines remotely.

    can be useful to enable remote access. Generically speaking, there are three different
    methods to do this:'

    to enable access to all virtual machines that you're hosting in an easy way.

    great if the host computer doesn't run anything but VMware.

- en: The VMware Web Service is an easy and convenient way to share machines with
    other users. To use this solution, you need to set up shared machines, but it's
    also a good idea to create a dedicated user account to share the virtual machines
    so that you can prevent remote users from getting access to the files on your
    computer. Be aware however that normal user accounts without administrator privileges
    won't be able to get access to other users' virtual machines. An administrator
    user can at least browse through virtual machines that other users have created.
    It is a lot easier to set up a dedicated account for the use of VMware Workstation,
    and from that account, share all virtual machines. This prevents you from the
    need to give too much access privileges to other users.

    where the shared virtual machine resides. This means that before setting up the
    shared virtual machine, you'll have to create these user accounts—unless you want
    the remote user to connect with your own username and password.

    accounts are probably already available. If you're running VMware Workstation
    on a Windows 8 computer, you'll need to set up a user account yourself. To do
    this, start the PC Settings application and click on **Users**. From here, select
    **Add a user** and follow the wizard to proceed through all of the required steps
    to create the user. You don't have to grant administrator privileges to the user,
    just create the user account and assign a password.

    so` command and enter the root password. Next, type `useradd -m username`. This
    adds the new user account to your computer. To set a password for this user, still
    as root, enter the `passwd` command and enter the new password twice.

    feature. This allows you to run a web service on the host''s operating system,
    which gives access to all virtual machines on that host. Enabling the VMware Workstation
    Server starts at the virtual machines that you want to provide access to. You''ll
    first have to share the virtual machine, after which the workstation''s server
    properties can be set. The procedure described as follows shows how this works:'

- en: To enable sharing for the selected virtual machine, you need to make it available
    in the shared VM's directory. You can do this by either moving the virtual machine,
    or making a full clone of it. If you choose the latter option, you will basically
    make a full copy of the virtual machine, which means that the cloned virtual machine
    is going to be an independent machine. This choice is useful if you want to be
    able to do different things in the share machines than what you're doing in the
    original machine. If you move the virtual machine, it's just the physical location
    that is moved. You won't experience it from the VMware Workstation interface;
    it's just a protection issue. The benefit of moving the virtual machine rather
    than cloning it is that you will work on the same virtual machine.![Sharing a

- en: In the previous section, you have learned how to create shared virtual machines
    within VMware. This option is useful if you want to share virtual machines with
    other users who are also using VMware. On the other hand, to access shared virtual
    machines from a remote computer that doesn't run VMware, this approach doesn't
    work and you will need something else. **VNC** might be a good solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: VNC is a generic protocol that you can use on any operating system to provide
    remote access. It works from physical computers as well as virtual machines. To
    open a virtual machine for VNC access, you can use the setup procedure for your
    specific operating system. Alternatively, you can also use the VMware Workstation
    virtual machine options to enable VNC access. In this section, you'll learn how
    to configure the VMware Workstation using VNC.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before starting to configure VNC on your virtual machines, you should consider
    the alternatives. VNC is great if you want to connect to a remote graphical desktop
    but if you want to access a virtual machine that runs in the console-only mode,
    you don't need it. In that case, use SSH or any other console-based virtual machine
    access method. It's easier to set up and is also more secure.

    properties. To do this, select the virtual machine and navigate to **VM** | **Settings**.
    Next, open the **Option** tab. On this tab, click on **VNC Connections**. The
    current status should be set to **Disabled**. Click on **Enable** to open VNC
    access for the virtual machine and select the port you want to use. Every virtual
    machine needs a dedicated port assignment. For the first VM that you'll share
    with VNC, the default port 5900 will do fine. All subsequent virtual machines
    need a dedicated port however, so choose port 5901 for the second virtual machine,
    5902 for the third, and so on. To add some extra protection, you can add a password
    as well. Next, click on **OK** to save the settings.

    you need a VNC Viewer. You can download a free VNC Viewer at [www.tightvnc.com/download.php](http://www.tightvnc.com/download.php).
    After downloading it, run the setup procedure. There is no need to do anything
    difficult, just select the default settings. The installation program gives you
    a VNC Viewer as well as a VNC Service. You can use the VNC service to provide
    remote access to your computer's desktop. You don't need it to connect to individual
    virtual machines on remote computers, but make sure to provide a password to the
    service to prevent unauthorized use.

    virtual machines. In the remote host box, enter the IP address of the computer
    that hosts the VNC shared virtual machine. Next, enter the port assignment as
    well. For the first virtual machine you want to connect to, you can use the default
    port assignment 5900; if you want to connect to any other virtual machine, you
    need to specify the port to the IP address, as in `192.168.1.117:5901`, and click
    on **Connect**. If you have protected VNC access with a password, enter the password
    now and click on **OK**. You'll now be connected to the virtual machine.

    commonly used function keys for use within the virtual machine. These include
    all keys that have a special function both in the virtual machine and in the host
    operating system, such as *Ctrl*, *Alt*, and *Ctrl + Alt + Del*. Use the buttons
    if you need to use these keys within the virtual machine.
