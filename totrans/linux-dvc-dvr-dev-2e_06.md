# Section 2 - Linux Kernel Platform Abstraction and Device Drivers

In this section, we'll first introduce the concept of a device tree, allowing us to declare and describe the non-discoverable devices present on the system, and then we'll learn how to deal with such devices. While dealing with such devices, we will introduce the concept of platform devices and their drivers, and we will learn how to write I2C and SPI device drivers.
