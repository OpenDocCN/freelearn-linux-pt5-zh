- en: The story of Tizen begins on February 11, 2011, when Nokia announced a partnership
    with Microsoft, which led to the end of MeeGo. Shortly after that, Intel and Samsung
    joined forces and started the Tizen project. Tizen is a trademark of the Linux
    Foundation, and as of today, more than 40 leading companies are directly involved
    in the project.

- en: Nowadays, the mobile market is under the control of the duopoly between Android
    and iOS, who make up about 90 percent of all mobile devices. The control of the
    other 10 percent of devices is spread primarily between other corporations such
    as Microsoft and BlackBerry. Innovations are slowing down because of patent wars,
    proprietary APIs, closed application stores, and billing platforms. As an engineer,
    I have had to communicate many times that some requested features of a mobile
    application cannot be implemented because of restrictions of the operating system
    or just because of missing APIs.

- en: Tizen is here, and it is bold enough to try to change the status quo. It is
    an innovative open source project that provides new opportunities on the mobile
    marketplace to application developers, hardware vendors, and telecommunication
    operators. To guarantee transparency and to prevent any single entity from taking
    control of the whole platform, Tizen is under open source governance. The objective
    is to establish a sustainable community of both companies and individuals, to
    put it at the center of the development process and to create a competitive alternative
    to the Android-iOS duopoly. Community members are encouraged to contribute and
    know what to expect from Tizen. Even smaller companies can get involved in the
    development of the platform, and their contributions can be accepted alongside
    the contributions of large corporations. Every contributor can participate in
    defining the future of Tizen. The main benefit for operators and OEMs is that
    they can customize the software and the services of the platform to match their
    own requirements and goals.

    tablets, personal computers, TVs, and photo cameras to home appliances and vehicles.
    The world and its technologies are moving forward, and the number of Internet-enabled
    devices is growing fast. New solutions are required to improve the communication
    between all these devices and to make our life easier. Tizen is here to fill the
    gap by providing flexibility and standardized solutions through open source software.'
