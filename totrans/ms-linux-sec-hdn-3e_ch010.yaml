- en: In the previous chapter, we reviewed the basics of **Discretionary Access Control**
    (**DAC**). Normal Linux file and directory permissions settings aren't very granular.
    With an **access control list** (**ACL**), we can fine-tune things to get the
    exact set of permissions that we really want. We can also use this capability
    to control access to files in shared directories.

    not very granular. With an ACL, we can allow only a certain person to access a
    file or directory, or we can allow multiple people to access a file or directory
    with different permissions for each person. If we have a file or a directory that's
    wide open for everyone, we can use an ACL to allow different levels of access
    for either a group or an individual. Toward the end of the chapter, we'll put
    what we've learned all together in order to manage a shared directory for a group.

    an ACL for a user. We then list the user's name, followed by another colon, and
    the list of permissions that we want to grant to this user. In this case, we're
    only allowing Maggie read access. We complete the command by listing the file
    to which we want to apply this ACL. The `getfacl` output shows that Maggie does
    indeed have read access. Finally, we see in the `ls -l` output that the group
    is listed as having read access, even though we've set the `600` permissions settings
    on this file. But, there's also a `+` sign, which tells us that the file has an
    ACL. When we set an ACL, the permissions for the ACL show up as group permissions

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There may be times when you'll want all files that get created in a shared directory
    to have the same ACL. We can do that by applying an inherited ACL to the directory.
    Although, understand that even though this sounds like a cool idea, creating files
    in the normal way will cause files to have the read/write permissions set for
    the group, and the read permission set for others. So, if you're setting this
    up for a directory where users just create files normally, the best that you can
    hope to do is to create an ACL that adds either the write or execute permissions
    for someone. Either that or ensure that users set the `600` permissions settings
    on all files that they create, assuming that users really do need to restrict
    access to their files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, if you're creating a shell script that creates files in a
    specific directory, you can include `chmod` commands to ensure that the files
    get created with the restrictive permissions that are necessary to make your ACL
    work as intended.
