# Appendix A. Getting Help and Finding Other Helpful Online Resources

Having worked through this book, there will probably be many questions that are still left or even after consulting [Appendix D](apd.html "Appendix D. Troubleshooting the Common Pitfalls"), *Troubleshooting the Common Pitfalls*, it might be quite possible that something just does not work out. Luckily, there are quite a few helpful volunteers who are willing to help.

This appendix will cover the following topics:

*   Meeting various communities
*   Where to get help
*   How to ask the right questions
*   Getting a new Allwinner-based device supported

# Meeting the community

It should come as no surprise that there are many online communities surrounding various projects and products. This is especially true considering all the development boards covered in this book and their SoCs. Each of these communities more or less focus on certain tasks. There are three most important ones with regard to this book. Firstly, the Olimex community, which focuses on all Olimex-created products and puts forward questions related to Olimex boards and peripherals. Similarly, there is a Cubietech community, which revolves around Cubieboards. Lastly, there is another important group of volunteers well-known among the bunch, and that is the linux-sunxi community. The name stems, as mentioned earlier, from the Allwinner SoC family and also pertains to their main interest. The linux-sunxi community focuses on bootloader, kernel, and driver development and gathers a lot of information about Allwinner SoCs on their wiki.

While it is wise to get help or, even better, to give help to other users via the Olimex or Cubietech communities when working on their hardware, the linux-sunxi community is very knowledgeable and generally helpful.

### Note

None of these communities have fulltime paid employees employed by any of these companies. They are volunteers who do not mind helping other users as they themselves might have received help from others. Additionally, this community has people from every corner of the world, so make sure you keep things nice and polite.

# Getting in touch with the Olimex community

The main contact point for Olimex is obviously their website, [http://www.olimex.com](http://www.olimex.com). While the site's initial and main focus is their shop, they have links to reach their forum, their wiki, and even to projects done by users to inspire others. The direct wiki URL is [http://www.olimex.com/wiki](http://www.olimex.com/wiki), and the direct URL for the forum is [http://www.olimex.com/forum](http://www.olimex.com/forum), which can be used to bypass the main site if desired. An account for the wiki will need to be requested with Olimex, but anybody can create a free forum account and get support there. Additionally, there is an **Internet Relay Chat** (**IRC**) channel on the Freenode IRC network, called *#olimex* where live chat is possible with other community members.

# Getting in touch with the Cubietech community

The official website of Cubietech is [http://www.cubieboard.org](http://www.cubieboard.org). The main site is mostly a blog where new products are announced. While the site suggests that there are various forums, these are actually links to unofficial external forums in various languages. Do note that this can be both an advantage as one can communicate in their native language, and a disadvantage as resources are split among various forums. Cubietech does not have an official forum, but rather uses a Google-groups mailing list that can be accessed as a forum via the Google web interface. The direct link to their forums is [http://www.cubieboard.org/forum/](http://www.cubieboard.org/forum/). There is also a read-only wiki available called **docs**, which can be directly accessed via [http://docs.cubieboard.org](http://docs.cubieboard.org). Also, Cubietech has an IRC chatroom on the Freenode network called *#cubieboard*. Finally, Cubietech has a web page, [http://www.cubieboard.org/support/](http://www.cubieboard.org/support/), where this and more is mentioned how to get support.

# Getting in touch with the linux-sunxi community

The linux-sunxi community also has an official website, which is their very resourceful wiki and can be found at [http://linux-sunxi.org](http://linux-sunxi.org). The wiki itself can be quite daunting but also very helpful. There are many tutorials and *how-to* sections for various tasks. Content is being continuously worked on by kernel hackers and regular users alike, including the author of the book. The linux-sunxi wiki might be a little more technical than this book, but it is a great resource that should not be overlooked. Additionally, there is also a mailing list where a lot of communication happens. Instructions on how to join or just browse the mailing list can be found on the linux-sunxi community website at [http://linux-sunxi.org/Mailing_list](http://linux-sunxi.org/Mailing_list). Just as with Olimex and Cubietech also, the linux-sunxi community can be found on the Freenode IRC network on channel *#linux-sunxi* where many users and developers contribute their knowledge.

# Getting help by asking the right questions

While the *where* has been covered in the earlier sections, the *how* is an equally, if not more, important aspect of getting help. Community members often do want to help, but questions such as *Help me, it doesn't work* are wrong on various levels; for one, what does not work? What have you tried so far to make it better? Also, it sounds demanding and when asking for help from a volunteer, demanding things usually does not help at all. So when asking a question via a forum, a mailing list, or an IRC channel, always try being polite and as clear as possible on how things are going wrong. Do not let language be a barrier; many community volunteers do not speak English natively themselves and understand that you might not be a native English speaker either, and that is okay. If in doubt or unsure at any point, Wikipedia has a small entry about how to behave in the online communities where the netiquette and online etiquette sections are of interest; you can find this at [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_technology](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_technology). Additionally, Eric S. Raymond also posted an interesting read called *How to ask questions the smart way* at [http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).

# Getting support for any new Allwinner-based hardware

Allwinner SoCs are widely used, and while some devices are very well documented, such as the Cubieboard, others might not yet be. Whether you have found a new device or are developing a new device based on one of the many development boards, this new device might not be supported yet. No worries, as Allwinner-based devices are extremely similar to each other, and all the knowledge acquired by working through this book will still be useful. But the hardware in question might not yet be supported by the kernel, the community, or otherwise. The linux-sunxi community has developed a *New Device howto* on their wiki that can be used to add support on your own! With the knowledge learned from this book at hand and from referring to the website, [http://linux-sunxi.org/New_Device_howto](http://linux-sunxi.org/New_Device_howto), this should be no problem at all.

# Summary

This appendix has introduced you to the main communities where additional help can be acquired from volunteers. The next appendix will give an overview of the various basic Linux commands used in this book.
