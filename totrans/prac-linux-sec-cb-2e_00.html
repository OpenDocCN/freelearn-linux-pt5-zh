<p class="mce-root">When setting up a Linux system, security is supposed to be an important part of all stages. A good knowledge of the fundamentals of Linux is essential to implementing a good security policy on the machine.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Linux, as it ships, is not completely secure, and it is the responsibility of the administrator to configure the machine in a way such that it becomes more secure. <em>Practical Linux Security Cookbook</em> will work as a practical guide for administrators and help them configure a more secure machine.</p>
<p class="mce-root">If you want to learn about Kernel configuration, filesystem security, secure authentication, network security, and various security tools for Linux, this book is for you.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Linux security is a massive subject and not everything can be covered in just one book. Still, <em>Practical Linux Security Cookbook</em> will give you a lot of recipes to help you secure your machine.</p>

<p><em>Practical Linux Security Cookbook</em> is intended for all those Linux users who already have knowledge of Linux filesystems and administration. You should be familiar with basic Linux commands. Understanding information security and its risks to a Linux system is also help you in understand the recipes more easily.</p>
<p>However, even if you are unfamiliar with information security, you will be able to easily follow and understand the recipes discussed.</p>
<p>Since <em>Practical Linux Security Cookbook</em> follows a practical approach, following the steps is very easy.</p>
