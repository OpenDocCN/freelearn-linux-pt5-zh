- en: A Linux-based system contains many commands. Each installed application is,
    in fact, a command. This appendix will give an overview of the most basic commands
    that should, in theory, be available in every basic Linux installation. Most of
    these commands will be used throughout this book, some of which are considered
    as the bare basics. This appendix is by no means an authoritative reference, but
    it should get you well on your way.

    three levels'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The four access levels are often abbreviated with their first letters, `ugoa`.
    Next to the access levels, there are the access rights, and here, we will look
    at the three common ones. Technically, there are four, but more on that in a minute!
    The two primary access rights are read and write access to a file or directory,
    which are abbreviated with `r` and `w`. The third access right is execute, abbreviated
    with `x`, which grants execution permission on a file to a user, group, or anybody
    else. So, for example, `chmod` itself would require the execute access right to
    be set for anybody to actually execute that file. The fourth access right is `x`
    again, but this time it is applied to a directory. Since directories cannot be
    executed, the access right has a different meaning here and hence has four access
    rights. For directories, it allows users, groups, or anybody else to actually
    change into the directory and read the list of files in it.

    is used. Each filesystem partitioning tool has different options and parameters,
    so the manual page for these commands should be checked for details. Generally
    speaking, when using the default settings, supplying the device-specific partition
    node, such as `/dev/sdb1`, for the first partition `(1)` on the second hard or

    It is unknown what `dd` stands for, but its purpose is to copy data. There are
    many possible arguments to `dd`, but the most important ones used in this book
    will be covered here. The `if` parameter specifies the input file where data is
    to be read from. The `of` parameter is the output file parameter where the data
    is to be written. With these two parameters, it is already possible to copy data
    from the source to the destination. What makes `dd` so versatile is the plethora
    of other parameters. The `seek` parameter allows you to change the start position
    where to start writing. The `skip` parameter allows you to change the start position
    from where data is read. The `bs` parameter, which stands for block-size, determines
    the size of the data blocks involved in the transaction, and in combination with
    the `count` parameter, determines how much data is to be copied. As `dd` allows
    you to very specifically control a copy operation, it is often used to write full
    images, bootloaders at specific locations, and much more, as shown in the following
    command. See the manual page for more information.
