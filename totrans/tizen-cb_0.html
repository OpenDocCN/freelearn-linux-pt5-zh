Shortly after that, Intel and Samsung joined forces and started the Tizen project. Tizen is a trademark of the Linux Foundation, and as of today, more than 40 leading companies are directly involved in the project.</p><p>Nowadays, the mobile market is under the control of the duopoly between Android and iOS, who make up about 90 percent of all mobile devices. The control of the other 10 percent of devices is spread primarily between other corporations such as Microsoft and BlackBerry. Innovations are slowing down because of patent wars, proprietary APIs, closed application stores, and billing platforms. As an engineer, I have had to communicate many times that some requested features of a mobile application cannot be implemented because of restrictions of the operating system or just because of missing APIs.</p><p>Tizen is here, and it is bold enough to try to change the status quo. It is an innovative open source project that provides new opportunities on the mobile marketplace to application developers, hardware vendors, and telecommunication operators. To guarantee transparency and to prevent any single entity from taking control of the whole platform, Tizen is under open source governance. The objective is to establish a sustainable community of both companies and individuals, to put it at the center of the development process and to create a competitive alternative to the Android-iOS duopoly. Community members are encouraged to contribute and know what to expect from Tizen. Even smaller companies can get involved in the development of the platform, and their contributions can be accepted alongside the contributions of large corporations. Every contributor can participate in defining the future of Tizen. The main benefit for operators and OEMs is that they can customize the software and the services of the platform to match their own requirements and goals.</p><p>Tizen targets different computer architectures and form factors: from smartphones, tablets, personal computers, TVs, and photo cameras to home appliances and vehicles. The world and its technologies are moving forward, and the number of Internet-enabled devices is growing fast. New solutions are required to improve the communication between all these devices and to make our life easier. Tizen is here to fill the gap by providing flexibility and standardized solutions through open source software.</p><p>The main purpose of this book is to support you in your open source journey and to help you in your quest to develop user-friendly and innovative mobile applications and services.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec03"/>Part 1 – Getting Started with Tizen</h2></div></div></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>Basic knowledge of general programming in web development is required. To follow the tutorials and experiment with the examples, you will need a decent development computer with Windows, Mac OS X, or Ubuntu.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is suitable for:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Mobile application developers</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Web developers who are interested in developing mobile applications</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Developers interested in porting existing web, Android, and/or Qt applications to Tizen</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Tizen developers who would like to improve their skills and knowledge</li></ul></div><p>The main focus of the book is Tizen web application development. It does not contain any tutorials on basic HTML5, JavaScript, or CSS programming; so, a decent knowledge of these technologies is required.
