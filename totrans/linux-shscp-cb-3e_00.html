<p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, path names, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "<span>Shebang is a line on which</span> <kbd>#!</kbd> <span>is prefixed to the interpreter path."</span></p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>
$&gt; env 
PWD=/home/clif/ShellCookBook 
HOME=/home/clif 
SHELL=/bin/bash 
# ... And many more lines
</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>
$&gt; env 
<strong>PWD=/home/clif/ShellCookBook</strong> 
HOME=/home/clif 
SHELL=/bin/bash 
# ... And many more lines
</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>
<strong>$ chmod a+x sample.sh</strong>
</pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> <span>and</span> <strong>important words</strong> <span>are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Select</span> <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> <span>from the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> <span>panel."</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</div>
