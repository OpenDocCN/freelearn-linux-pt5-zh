All the concepts and tasks covered in this book are for vSphere Replication 5.5 and VMware vCenter Site Recovery Manager 5.5.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Installing and Configuring vCenter Site Recovery Manager (SRM) 5.5">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Installing and Configuring vCenter Site Recovery Manager (SRM) 5.5</em>, introduces you to the architecture of SRM and also guides you through the process of installing and configuring SRM to leverage array-based replication.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Creating Protection Groups and Recovery Plans">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Creating Protection Groups and Recovery Plans</em>, teaches you how to configure protection for virtual machines by creating Protection Groups and creating an orchestrated runbook with the help of Recovery Plans.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Testing and Performing a Failover and Failback">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Testing and Performing a Failover and Failback</em>, teaches you how to test the recovery plans that were created and also perform a Planned Migration, a Failover, and a Failback using them.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Deploying vSphere Replication 5.5">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Deploying vSphere Replication 5.5</em>, guides you through the steps required in deploying vSphere Replication Appliances and vSphere Replication Servers.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Configuring and Using vSphere Replication 5.5">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Configuring and Using vSphere Replication 5.5</em>, teaches you how to add target sites and enable replication on virtual machines and recover them. It will also teach you to configure vCenter SRM to leverage vSphere Replication engine.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>If you were to follow along with each chapter by practicing the tasks in a lab, then you would need two ESXi hosts, two vCenter Servers, two SRM instances, and two storage array nodes with replication configured between them. This might sound like a lot of hardware, but all you need is VMware Workstation 9.x or 10.x and a Virtual Storage Appliance such as HP Store Virtual 9500 (LeftHand networks). You could get a trial license for HP Store Virtual by registering for one at HP's website. The ESXi hosts, vCenter Servers, vSphere Replication Appliances, SRM Servers, and the storage nodes would be virtual machines that are hosted using VMware Workstation.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is a guide for anyone who is keen on using vSphere Replication or vCenter Site Recovery Manager as a disaster recovery solution. This is an excellent handbook for solution architects, administrators, on-field engineers, and support professionals. Although the book assumes that the reader has some basic knowledge of data center virtualization using VMware vSphere, it can still be a very good reference for anyone who is new to virtualization.</p></div>
