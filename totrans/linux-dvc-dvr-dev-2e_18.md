# Section 4 - Misc Kernel Subsystems for the Embedded World

This section will touch upon the IIO framework, pin control and GPIO systems, and other important feature-rich concepts. In this section, you will also gain an in-depth understanding of GPIOs mapped to interrupts and their processing mechanisms, describing every kernel data structure and API involved. Finally, youâ€™ll learn how to deal with input devices drivers. It goes without saying that user-space handlings of the enumerated subsystems will be introduced in this section as well.

The following chapters will be covered in this section:

*   [*Chapter 15*](B17934_15_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor218), *Digging into the IIO Framework*
*   [*Chapter 16*](B17934_16_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor242), *Getting the Most Out of the Pin Controller and GPIO Subsystems*
*   [*Chapter 17*](B17934_17_Epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256), *Leveraging the Linux Kernel Input Subsystem*
