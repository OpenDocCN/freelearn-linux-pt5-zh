    also how to lay the groundwork for an SRM-protected environment. We learned how
    to create resources, folder, and network mappings and configure placeholder datastores
    and array managers.

    the next step is to grant protection to the virtual machines. Before we delve
    into the procedural steps involved in protecting virtual machines, it is very
    important to understand a couple of basic concepts such as datastore and Protection
    Groups.

- en: A datastore group is a container that aggregates one or more replication-enabled
    datastores. The datastore groups are created by SRM and cannot be manually altered.
    A replication-enabled datastore is a datastore who's LUN has a replication schedule
    enabled at the array.

- en: A datastore group will contain only a single datastore if the datastore doesn't
    store files of virtual machines from other datastores. See the preceding single-datastore
    datastore group conceptual diagram.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A datastore group can also contain more than one datastore. SRM aggregates multiple
    datastores into a single group if they have virtual machines whose files are distributed
    onto these datastores. For example, if VM-A has two VMDKs placed on datastores
    Datastore-M and Datastore-N each, and then both these datastores become part of
    the same datastore group. These datastore groups further aid in the creation of
    Protection Groups.

- en: Unlike **vSphere Replication**, SRM cannot enable protection on individual virtual
    machines. All the virtual machines that are hosted on the datastores in a datastore
    group are protected. Meaning, with SRM, protection is enabled at the datastore
    group level. This is because, with an array-based replication, the LUNs backing
    the datastores are replicated. The array doesn't know which VMs are hosted on
    the datastore. It just replicates the LUN, block by block. So, at the SRM layer,
    the protection is enabled at the datastore level. In a way, a Protection Group
    is nothing but a software construct to which datastore groups are added, which
    in turn includes all the VMs stored on them in the Protection Group.

- en: 'When creating a Protection Group, you will have to choose the datastore groups
    that will be included. Keep in mind that you cannot individually select the datastores
    in a datastore group. If it were ever allowed to do so, then you will have virtual
    machines with not all of its files protected. Let''s assume that you have a virtual
    machine, VM-A, with two disks (VMDK-1 and VMDK-2) placed on two different datastores.
    Let''s also say VMDK-1 is on Datastore-X and VMDK-2 is on Datastore-Y. When creating
    a Protection Group, if you were allowed to select the individual datastores and
    if you choose only one of them, then you will leave the remaining disks of the
    VM unprotected. Hence, SRM doesn''t allow selecting individual datastores from
    a datastore group as a measure to prevent such a scenario. The following diagram
    shows the modified conceptual structure of the datastore group:'

    purpose or VMs of the same type/priority in an SRM-protected environment are segregated
    onto separate datastores to aid easier management of the Protection Groups.
