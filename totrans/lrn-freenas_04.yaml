    need much attention, it should just work. However, there are lots of different
    features which can be configured. This chapter will look at some of the common
    administration tasks for setting up your FreeNAS server.

- en: Until now, we have only used the FreeNAS server in an "anonymous" mode, meaning
    that anyone can connect to the server and read, create, and delete files. This
    isn't always what you want, so FreeNAS has some user management features that
    change the way CIFS, FTP, and AFP allow users to connect to the server.

- en: The 0.6 series of FreeNAS releases has rather blunt user management. The defined
    users have access or they don't have access, period. There is no granularity;
    for example being able to give some users read access while others have read/write
    access.
  prefs: []

    a folder on a selected disk), with user/group/quota property on this share. This
    implies a greater level of control.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first step to creating a user is in fact to create a group. Each user must
    belong to a group. Groups are sets of users who are associated with one another.
    So in your business, you might have a *sales* group and a *engineering* group.
    At home, you probably only want one group, for example *home*.

- en: The two can be used together; however, they do negate one another in terms of
    security. It is best to run the FTP with either anonymous logins enabled and local
    user logins disabled or vice versa. If you run with both enabled, then people
    can still log in using the anonymous method even if they don't have a user account
    and so, it diminishes the benefits of having the user accounts enabled.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other than the security benefits, another advantage of local user login with
    FTP is that you can define a home directory for the user and when the user logs
    in, they will be taken to that directory and only they have access to that directory
    and those below it. This effectively offers each user their own space on the server
    and other users cannot interfere with their files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    can do this with any of the access protocols CIFS, NFS, FTP, and AFS. You need

    the FreeNAS and FreeBSD system files. It is much safer to have this box checked.
    The exception to this is the user root (which in FreeBSD terms is the system administer
    account). If **Permit root login** is enabled, then the user root can log in and
    they will be taken to the root of the actual server. This can be useful if you

    web browser to connect to the FreeNAS server over a secure encrypted connection.
    If your FreeNAS server is in an environment where people can "snoop" on the network
    to discover the passwords being used, it is best to use HTTPS. This is also true
    if you have configured your network in such a way that your FreeNAS can be administered
    from the Internet (probably through a firewall). This can be useful when the FreeNAS
    server is in a different location than the person responsible for administering

    server presents the browser with a certificate identifying itself. This certificate
    contains unique, authenticated information about the certificate owner. To be
    sure that this information is correct, a 3^(rd) party needs to vouch for the certificate
    and say it is trustworthy. This 3^(rd) party is called a Certificate Authority
    (CA) and they verify the identity of the certificate owner. They establish a level

    it is acceptable as it isn't the trust of the server that is required but rather
    the ability to talk securely. Once you accept the certificate, the secure communications
