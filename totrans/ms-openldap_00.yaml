- en: The OpenLDAP directory server is a mature product that has been around (in one
    form or another) since 1995\. All of the major Linux distributions include the
    OpenLDAP server, and many major applications, both Open Source and proprietary,
    are directory aware, and can make use of the services provided by OpenLDAP. And
    yet the OpenLDAP server seems to be shrouded in mystery, known and understood
    only by the gurus and hackers. This book is meant not only to demystify OpenLDAP,
    but to give the system administrator and software developer a solid understanding
    of how to make use, in the practical realm, of OpenLDAP’s directory services.

- en: OpenLDAP is an Open Source server that provides network clients with directory
    services. The directory server can be used to store organizational information
    in a centralized location, and make this information available to authorized applications.
    Client applications can connect to OpenLDAP using the Lightweight Directory Access
    Protocol (LDAP). They can then search the directory and (if they have appropriate
    access) modify and manipulate records in the directory. LDAP servers are most
    frequently used to provide network-based authentication services for users. But
    there are many other uses for an LDAP, including using the directory as an address
    book, a DNS database, an organizational tool, or even as a network object store
    for applications. We will look at some of these uses in this book.

- en: The goal of this book is to prepare a system administrator or software developer
    for building a directory using OpenLDAP, and then employing this directory in
    the context of the network. To that end, this book will take a practical approach,
    emphasizing how to get things done. On occasion, we will delve into theoretical
    aspects of LDAP, but such discussions will only occur where understanding the
    theory helps us answer practical questions.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Directory Servers and LDAP") we look at
    general concepts of directory servers and LDAP, cover the history of LDAP and
    the lineage of the OpenLDAP server, and finish up with a technical overview of
    OpenLDAP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next set of chapters focus on building directory services with OpenLDAP,
    and we take a close look at the OpenLDAP server in these chapters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Installation and Configuration") begins with
    the process of installing OpenLDAP on a GNU/Linux server. Once we have the server
    installed, we do the basic post-installation configuration necessary to have the
    server running.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Using OpenLDAP") covers the basic use of
    the OpenLDAP server. We use the OpenLDAP command-line tools to add records to
    our new directory, search the directory, and modify records. This chapter introduces
    many of the key concepts involved in working with LDAP data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Securing OpenLDAP") covers security, including
    handling authentication to the directory, configuring Access Control Lists (ACLs),
    and securing network-based directory connections with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
    and Transport Layer Security (TLS).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Advanced Configuration") deals with advanced
    configuration of the OpenLDAP server. Here, we take a close look at the various
    backend database options and also look at performance tuning settings, as well
    as the recently introduced technology of directory overlays.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. LDAP Schemas") focuses on extending the directory
    structure by creating and implementing LDAP schemas. Schemas provide a procedure
    for defining new attributes and structures to extend the directory and provide
    records tailor-made to your needs.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Multiple Directories") focuses on directory
    replication and different ways of getting directory servers to interoperate over
    a network. OpenLDAP can replicate its directory contents from a master server
    to any number of subordinate servers. In this chapter, we set up a replication
    process between two servers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. LDAP and the Web") deals with configuring
    other tools to interoperate with OpenLDAP. We begin with the Apache web server,
    using LDAP as a source of authentication and authorization. Next, we install phpLDAPadmin,
    a web-based program for managing directory servers. Then we look at the main features,
    and do some custom tuning.'

    ([Appendix A](apa.html "Appendix A. Building OpenLDAP from Source")), a guide
    to using LDAP URLs ([Appendix B](apb.html "Appendix B. LDAP URLs")), and a compendium
    of useful LDAP client commands ([Appendix C](apc.html "Appendix C. Useful LDAP
    Commands")).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To get the most from this book, you will need the OpenLDAP server software,
    as well as the client command-line utilities. These are all freely available (as
    Open Source software) in source code form from [http://openldap.org](http://openldap.org).
    However, you may prefer to use the version of OpenLDAP provided by your particular
    Linux or UNIX distribution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While OpenLDAP will run on Linux, various versions of UNIX, MacOS X, and Windows
    2000 and so on, the examples in this book use the Linux operating system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the basic LDAP tools are command-line applications, you will need basic
    knowledge of getting around in a Linux/UNIX shell environment. The book does not
    cover the network protocol in detail, and it is assumed that the reader has a
    basic understanding of client-server network models. It is also assumed that the
    reader has a basic understanding of the structure of web and email services.
