  zh: 前言
- en: Nagios Core, the open source version of the Nagios monitoring framework, is
    an industry standard for network monitoring hosted on Unix-like systems, such
    as GNU/Linux or BSD. It is very often used by network and system administrators
    for checking connectivity between hosts and ensuring that network services are
    running as expected.

  zh: Nagios Core，作为Nagios监控框架的开源版本，是托管在类似Unix系统上的网络监控行业标准，如GNU/Linux或BSD。它通常被网络和系统管理员用于检查主机之间的连接性，并确保网络服务按预期运行。
- en: Where home-grown scripts performing network checks can rapidly become unmaintainable
    and difficult for newer administrators to customize safely, Nagios Core provides
    a rigorous and configurable monitoring framework to make checks in a consistent
    manner and to alert appropriate people and systems of any problem it detects.

  zh: 许多自家编写的脚本执行网络检查时，可能会迅速变得无法维护，而且对新手管理员来说，定制起来也不安全。而Nagios Core提供了一个严格且可配置的监控框架，以一致的方式进行检查，并向适当的人员和系统发送通知，告知它检测到的任何问题。
- en: This makes Nagios Core a very general monitoring framework rather than an out-of-the-box
    monitoring solution, which is known to make it a little unfriendly to beginners
    and something of a "black box", even to otherwise experienced administrators.
    Busy administrators charged with setting up a Nagios Core system will often set
    it up to send PING requests to a set of hosts every few minutes and send them
    an e-mail about any problem, and otherwise never touch it. More adventurous administrators
    new to the system might instate a few HTTP checks to make sure that company websites
    respond.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这使得Nagios Core成为一个非常通用的监控框架，而不是一个开箱即用的监控解决方案，这也让它在初学者中显得有些不友好，即便是经验丰富的管理员，也会觉得它有点像一个“黑盒子”。繁忙的管理员在设置Nagios
    Core系统时，通常会将其配置为每隔几分钟向一组主机发送PING请求，并在出现任何问题时发送电子邮件通知，而其他部分则不再处理。对于那些刚接触该系统的冒险型管理员，他们可能会设置一些HTTP检查，确保公司网站响应正常。
- en: Nagios Core is capable of a great deal more than that, and this book's recipes
    are intended to highlight all of the different means of refining and controlling
    checks, notifications, and reporting for Nagios Core, rather than being a list
    of instructions for using specific plugins, of which there are many hundreds available
    online at the Nagios Exchange at [http://exchange.nagios.org/](http://exchange.nagios.org/).
    The book's fundamental aim is to get administrators excited about the possibilities
    of Nagios Core beyond elementary default checking behavior, so that they can use
    much more of the framework's power, and make it into the centerpiece of their
    network monitoring.

  zh: Nagios Core的功能远不止这些，本书的食谱旨在强调精细化和控制Nagios Core检查、通知和报告的各种方法，而不仅仅是列出使用特定插件的指令，网上有成百上千个插件可以在Nagios
    Exchange平台上找到，网址为[http://exchange.nagios.org/](http://exchange.nagios.org/)。本书的根本目标是让管理员对Nagios
    Core的潜力产生兴趣，超越基础的默认检查行为，从而能够利用更多框架的功能，使其成为网络监控的核心。
- en: This also includes installing and even writing custom plugins beyond the standard
    Nagios Plugins set, writing and refining one's own checks, working with the very
    powerful **Simple Network Management Protocol** (**SNMP**), recording and reporting
    of performance data, refining notification behavior to only send appropriate notifications
    at appropriate times to appropriate people or systems, basic visualization options,
    identifying breakages in network paths, clever uses of the default web interface,
    and even extending Nagios Core with other open source programs, all in order to
    check virtually any kind of host property or network service on any network.
  id: totrans-5
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这还包括安装甚至编写自定义插件，超出标准的Nagios插件集，编写和优化自己的检查，使用非常强大的**简单网络管理协议**（**SNMP**），记录和报告性能数据，优化通知行为，仅在适当的时间将适当的通知发送给适当的人或系统，基本的可视化选项，识别网络路径中的故障，巧妙使用默认的Web界面，甚至通过其他开源程序扩展Nagios
    Core，所有这些都是为了检查几乎任何类型的主机属性或网络服务，适用于任何网络。
- en: Where possible, this book focuses on add-ons written by the Nagios team themselves,
    particularly NRPE and NSCA. It omits discussion of the popular NRPE replacement
    `check_mk`, and of popular forks of Nagios Core such as Icinga. In the interest
    of conferring an in-depth understanding of advanced Nagios Core configuration,
    it also does not discuss any configuration frontends or wizards such as NConf.
    Finally, as a Packt open source series book focusing on the use of the freely
    available Nagios Core, it also does not directly discuss the use of Nagios XI,
    the commercial version of the software supported by the Nagios team. This is done
    to instill a thorough understanding of Nagios Core itself, rather than to reflect
    personal opinions of the author; curious administrators should definitely investigate
    all of these projects (particularly `check_mk`).
  id: totrans-6
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在可能的情况下，本书着重介绍由Nagios团队自己编写的插件，特别是NRPE和NSCA。它省略了对流行的NRPE替代品`check_mk`以及Nagios
    Core的流行分支（如Icinga）的讨论。为了深入理解高级Nagios Core配置，书中也未讨论任何配置前端或向导工具，如NConf。最后，作为一本聚焦于免费可用的Nagios
    Core的Packt开源系列书籍，它也没有直接讨论Nagios XI的使用——这是Nagios团队支持的商业版软件。这样做是为了深入理解Nagios Core本身，而不是反映作者的个人观点；有兴趣的管理员应当研究所有这些项目（特别是`check_mk`）。

    installed in `/usr/local/nagios`, by following the Nagios Quickstart Guides available

    particular issue with the `nagios3` package on Debian or Ubuntu systems. If you
    are familiar with the differences in the installation layout that your packaging
    system imposes, then you should still be able to follow the recipes with only

    default more recently. Some of the graphical elements and styles are different,
    but everything has the same text and is in the same place, so it's not necessary
