    Plans. As discussed, Recovery Plans are nothing but a previously created workflow
    for the recovery of a failed site. In this chapter, we will learn how to test
    Recovery Plans that are already created, how to use them to perform a Failover,
    panned migration, reprotect, and Failback.

- en: When you initiate a test, SRM instructs the **Storage Replication Adapter**
    to execute a replication cycle to replicate the latest changes to the replica
    LUN at the recovery site. However, this will only happen if you had chosen to
    leave the default option to replicate recent changes checked. You wouldn't need
    to replicate the recent change when the replication is synchronous, as the replica
    would already have the latest change. Refer to your replication vendor documentation
    for more information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the replication is complete, it then needs to find a way to present the
    replica LUN's data to the recovery ESXi hosts so that the virtual machines can
    be powered on. This is achieved differently by different storage arrays. The most
    common methodology is to create a writable snapshot of the replica LUN, and then
    present the snapshot to the recovery ESXi hosts. The hosts will subsequently scan
    their HBAs to detect the VMFS volumes on the LUN.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before the snapshot is presented to the ESXi hosts, SRM needs to make sure that
    there is enough room (compute capacity) at the recovery site to power on the recovered
    VMs. To make room for the VMs, SRM could power off the noncritical VMs (*if included
    in the Recovery Plan*) and also power up the ESXi hosts that were put into the
    standby mode (if any) by the **Distributed Power Management** (**DPM**).

    vCenter Server. This is achieved by replacing the shadow VM entries with the entries
    corresponding to the recovered VMs. Keep in mind that the shadow VMs are mere
    inventory objects and that they do not have any VMDKs mapped to them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    can either be a port group that you created for the test or an auto bubble network

    wait for all the VMs in a **Priority Group** to Failover successfully or fail
    to Failover before it attempts to power on VMs from a group with lower priority.
    For instance, SRM will wait for all the VMs in **Priority Group 2** to Failover
    before it can attempt the Failover of the VMs in **Priority Group 3**. This is
    because **Priority Group 2** has a higher priority than **Priority Group 3**.

    are in the same Priority Group? Can we configure a startup order within a Priority
    Group? The answer is yes. This is where VM Dependencies come in handy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's consider a three-tier application, which has a database, a server component,
    and the user interface component hosted on three different VMs. Now, in this case
    the server component is dependent on the availability of the database, and the
    user interface component is dependent on the server component. This means the
    database VM should start first, then the VM hosting the service component, and
    finally the VM hosting the user interface component. Such a startup order can
    be achieved using the VM Dependencies Recovery Property.
