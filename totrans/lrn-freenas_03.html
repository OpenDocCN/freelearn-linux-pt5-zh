Before looking at each of these protocols individually, it is worth looking at them as a whole and seeing why each protocol exists and for which job is it best suited.</p><p>The table below lists each protocol along with which type of computer (Windows, Apple Mac etc) can connect to the FreeNAS server using that protocol. Some protocols are native to a particular platform, for examples CIFS is native protocol for Windows machines, but other operating systems like OS X can "talk" CIFS as well. Also listed, is the main use of that protocol.<a id="id107" class="indexterm"/>

Connecting to remote raw disks with the SCSI over IP protocol.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In this chapter, we are going to look in detail at the various protocols. To help you in this, it will be best if you have a test FreeNAS server up and running and you have followed the quick installation and configuration guide in Chapter 2.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec02"/>Connecting via CIFS</h1></div></div></div><p>The Common Internet File System (CIFS) is the standard way in which files are accessed on a remote Windows computer. Developed and maintained by Microsoft for use on their Windows platform, it has also been implemented on most major operating systems including OS X and Linux using 3rd party software, the most popular of which is called Samba. Samba is open source software that provides remote file access services to CIFS clients on a variety of platforms (including to Windows clients). Samba is included in the FreeNAS server.<a id="id109" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The abilities of CIFS are actually larger than just accessing files. With it, other resources like printers can also be shared on the network, but for FreeNAS, CIFS is used to share disks on the server and make them available to other computers that understand the CIFS protocol. This means that Windows, Linux, and OS X machines are all capable of accessing files on the FreeNAS server via the CIFS protocol.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"/>Note</h3><p>Sometimes, when reading about CIFS, you might read the term SMB or Server Message Block. SMB was the original name of the CIFS protocol and was the result of work done by IBM and then later Microsoft. In 1996, SMB was renamed CIFS.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec01"/>Configure CIFS on the FreeNAS Server</h2></div></div></div><p>Before attempting to connect another computer to the FreeNAS server via CIFS, you need to be sure that CIFS is correctly configured on the FreeNAS server.<a id="id110" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>1. Go to Services:<strong> CIFS/SMB</strong>. This page contains two tabs, first, the<strong> settings</strong> page and then the<strong> shares</strong> page. First of all, make sure that the service is enabled by ticking the "Enable" box in the title bar of the configuration table.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>2. To get CIFS working with the default settings, you need to set as a minimum the Authentication system, the NetBios Name, and the Workgroup. Authentication should be left at Anonymous for the moment. We will look more at authentication and user management in FreeNAS in the next chapter. The NetBios Name is the name that the FreeNAS server will have on the Windows network. When you want to access the server, Windows lets you use a friendly name rather than the IP. For this example, we will use the name FreeNAS. Finally, you need to enter the workgroup. All Windows machines belong either to a workgroup or a domain.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip43"/>Note</h3><p><strong>Workgroups and Domains</strong></p><p>Home networks and small office LANs use workgroups, which are essentially collections of computers that share a similar tag or designation. On a home network, there is normally only 1 workgroup called "WORKGROUP" (or MSHOME if you mainly have Windows XP machines. For the small office environment, there might be 2 or 3 workgroups, maybe "SALES", "ENGINEERING", and "ACCOUNTS". The workgroup links the machines together so that when the network is viewed, these machines will be grouped together. There are typically no more than ten to twenty computers in a workgroup and all the computers must be on the same local network.</p><p>Larger business networks use domains rather than workgroups. In a domain, there is a server (called the domain controller) that controls the resources and security in that domain. Once a user has a domain account, they can log on to any computer in the domain without needing a local account on any particular machine. Domains can have thousands of computers spread across several networks.</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>3. Enter in the workgroup name for the FreeNAS server. It will probably be WORKGROUP or maybe XPHOME if you have many Windows XP machines on your network.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>4. The next step is to configure what disks are shared on the network. Click on <strong>Save and Restart</strong> at the bottom of the page and then click the<strong> Shares</strong> tab at the top. Here is where you add disks to be shared on the network via the CIFS protocol. You can only share previously configured disks. If you have disks that need to be added to the FreeNAS, go to the Disk: menu. For more information, see the quick start guide in Chapter 2 or for advanced information, go to Chapter 6.<a id="id111" class="indexterm"/>
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>5. Click the add circle. You are now in<strong> Services: CIFS/SMB: Share: Add</strong>. The minimum data here is the<strong> Name</strong> you want to give the share, a Comment or description about the share and where the share is, the Path.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>6. Name and comment should be easy enough to fill in. For this example, we will use store and a storage place respectively. Now, for the path. In FreeNAS, all disks are mounted under<strong> /mnt</strong>. This means that the path will be something like<strong> /mnt/diskname</strong>. To find the right path name, click on<strong> ...</strong> This will bring up a new window.</p></li></ol></div><div><img src="img/4688_04_01.jpg" alt="Configure CIFS on the FreeNAS Server"/></div><p>At the top, you will see<strong> /mnt</strong> and then further down<strong> store</strong>. This is the name of the disk that was configured in<strong> Disks: Mount Point: Add</strong>. Click on store and the path will change to<strong> /mnt/path</strong>.</p><div><img src="img/4688_04_02.jpg" alt="Configure CIFS on the FreeNAS Server"/></div><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>7. Click on<strong> OK</strong>, then on<strong> Add</strong>, and finally, apply the changes.<a id="id112" class="indexterm"/>
</p></li></ol></div><p>At this point, CIFS is configured and ready to go. Before looking at how the different versions of Windows, as well as OS X and Linux, can connect to FreeNAS using CIFS, let us look in details at the other parameters.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec01"/>CIFS Settings Explained</h3></div></div></div><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col width="1.44284422059422" style="text-align: left"/><col width="4.06845238095238" style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom">

This is determined by the default create and directory masks (see above).</p><p>Using a numbering scheme, the create or directory mask has four number places starting always with 0, for example 0744, representing the three levels. The first number on the left side is for "user", the middle one is for "group", and the right-hand one for "world." Here is what each number means:</p><p>0 = no access, 1 = execute only, 2 = write only, 3 = write and execute, 4 = read only, 5 = read and execute, 6 = read and write, 7 = read, write and execute (full access).</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec03"/>Options when Adding Shares</h3></div></div></div><p>Like the general CIF settings, there are several different options available when you add a share on the<strong> Services: CIFS/SMB: Share: Add page</strong>.

One is to browse to it using the <em>My Network Places</em> (or similar depending on your version of Windows). Here, you can find a machine and then drill down until you find the folder you want. The other option is to mount the remote shared folder as a drive on your machine. This<em> network drive</em> always takes you to the right place where the data is on the remote server. You can also configure it to be mounted every time you start windows. This is particularly useful for something like the FreeNAS server as the storage space made available is always available on your PC.<a id="id114" class="indexterm"/>

For example in Kubuntu, to get a listing similar to My Network Places in Windows, open Konqueror and enter<strong> smb:/</strong> in the address bar. This will then show you the workgroups available. From here, you can drill down to the FreeNAS server and the store share. This should work for all KDE-based distributions like Mandriva and SuSE. Alternatively, you use the<strong> Remote Places</strong> icon that you will find on the System Menu (which isn't to be confused with the K Menu). Here, you can click on<strong> Samba Shares</strong>, which will take you to the smb:/ listing.</p><div><img src="img/4688_04_06.jpg" alt="Accessing the FreeNAS via CIFS from Linux"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec07"/>A CIFS Connection from OS X</h2></div></div></div><p>Apple's OS X operating system has full Windows connectivity. With the release of OS X 10.5 Leopard, it's easy of use has also been improved. Leopard will automatically detect the available CIFS shared resources available on the local area network. They appear in the Finder window on the left-hand-side under SHARED. Click on the resource you want to use (in case of FreeNAS, it will say "freenas SMB Service") and from there, you just access them as you would any other folder.<a id="id121" class="indexterm"/>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec03"/>FTP</h1></div></div></div><p>While CIFS and NFS are file system protocols, which means that whole file systems can be shared on the network and other computers can uses those file systems as if they were attached locally, FTP is more limited in that it is designed just to for the transfer of files from one computer to another. In CIFS and NFS, when you read or write to files, they remain on the remote server, whereas with FTP, files are transferred from the server to the local machine or vice-versa. Any changes you make to the files once downloaded to your computer, will not be reflected in the files on the server.<a id="id122" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The main use of the FTP protocol is for downloading files from the server onto the local computer. Files can be uploaded once to the server (also by FTP) and then downloaded many times by those who need the files. This can be useful in one of two ways:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>For the small office or home environment, it is perfect as a repository for downloaded software and drivers. As all web browsers have support for FTP, it means that files can be downloaded on to the local machine with just a standard web browser, or more complex FTP clients can be used.<a id="id123" class="indexterm"/>
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the business environment, if there is a company Intranet, then links from the various internal websites can link to files on the FreeNAS server via FTP. This is particularly useful if there are large files to be downloaded that don't need to reside on the web server.</p></li></ul></div><p>FTP also supports the uploading of files to the server. Here, those responsible for the Intranet or file repository upload the files to the FreeNAS server and then those needing the files can download them as described above.</p><p>To configure the FTP service, go to<strong> Services: FTP</strong> and tick the<strong> Enable</strong> box.

All the major operating systems (including Windows also) include a built in command line FTP program. They are all essentially the same regardless of operating system so if you know how to use the command line FTP program on OS X, you will be able to manage on Linux and so on. For this example we will use Apple's OS X.<a id="id126" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>To start, you need to open a terminal window (on OS X or Linux) or a command prompt (on Windows). To connect to the FreeNAS server you type:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>ftp 192.168.1.250</strong>
</pre></div><p>Where<code class="literal"> 192.168.1.250</code> is the IP address of the FreeNAS server, you will need to enter the IP address of the FreeNAS if yours is different.</p><p>The first thing you need to enter is a user name, for now we will use anonymous FTP, which means that anyone can access the FTP. The next chapter we will look at user management and authentication. So enter:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>anonymous</strong>
</pre></div><p>Now, you will need to enter a password. As we are doing an anonymous login, any password will do, including just pressing 
<em>ENTER</em>.</p><p>You will then be in the FTP program and you will see the prompt <strong>ftp&gt;</strong>.</p><p>To see a listing of what is in the directory, we use the<code class="literal"> ls</code> command.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec04"/>NFS</h1></div></div></div><p>The Network Filing System is the UNIX equivalent to the CIFS protocol. Although there are 3rd party packages to allow Windows machines to use NFS resources, NFS has remained most dominant on the UNIX/Linux operating systems.<a id="id132" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>To configure the NFS service, go to the<strong> Services: NFS</strong> page. As with all the other services, to enable it you need to tick the Enable box.<a id="id133" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>There are few parameters for NFS, but they are important.</p><div><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The following instructions are for the 0.68 series of FreeNAS releases. The 0.69 and 0.7 versions of FreeNAS treat NFS slightly differently but essentially the ideas are the same.</p><p>In 0.69 and 0.7 please note the following differences:</p><p>The Services: NFS settings page now has two tabs; <em>Settings</em> and <em>Shares</em>.</p><p>The Settings tab has a new parameter: <em>Number of servers</em> that specifies how many NFS processes to create. There needs to be enough processes to handle the maximum level of concurrency from NFS clients on the network. A typical figure would be four to six.</p><p>The NFS set-up now has the concept of shares (very similar to that of CIFS), to make a folder or disk available on the network a 'share' must be created for it. To do this you click on the <em>Shares</em> tab and click the Add circle.</p><p>The rest of the parameters described below are now set on a per share basis and not for the whole server.</p></div><p>The first parameter is <em>Map all users to root</em>. This means that on the FreeNAS machine remote users will have root privilege (or administrator right in Windows terminology) while accessing the disks over NFS. This is generally a bad idea and while the default is <em>yes</em>, it is best to change it to <em>no</em>. Also, any OS X clients connecting to the FreeNAS via NFS will issue a few warnings about needing usernames and passwords. When <em>Map all users to root</em> is set to <em>no</em>, this doesn't happen.<a id="id134" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The second parameter is the list of authorized networks that are allowed to connect to the FreeNAS server via NFS. This list of authorized networks is defined by setting which group of addresses can access the server.<a id="id135" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>If your FreeNAS server has a netmask of 255.255.255.0 (which is most probably the case) then:</p><p>Click the add circle and enter the first 3 numbers of the IP address of the FreeNAS server (with . in between) and then finish it with dot zero (.0). For example, if the IP address of the FreeNAS server is 192.168.1.250, then you would enter 192.168.1.0 for the authorized network. Finally, select 24 (in other words 255.255.255.0) in the drop down box.</p><p>If you are using a netmask of 255.255.0.0, then you need to enter the first 2 numbers of the IP address and end with dot zero dot zero (.0.0), for example 192.168.0.0. Set the drop down box to 16.</p><p>If you are using a netmask of 255.0.0.0, then you need to enter just the first number of the IP address and end with dot zero dot zero dot zero (.0.0.0), e.g. 192.0.0.0. The drop down box needs to be set to 8.</p><p>If you are unsure what the value of the netmask is, then go to Interfaces: LAN and see the IP Address field. You need to set the drop down box in the Services: NFS page to that of the value of the drop down box in the IP Address field.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec10"/>Using NFS from OS X</h2></div></div></div><p>At the core of Apple's OS X, is the open source UNIX operating system called Darwin. As a result, OS X natively understands the NFS protocol. To connect to the FreeNAS server from OS X, open the Finder and the Go-&gt;Connect to Server... (Or Apple-K as a shortcut)<a id="id136" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>In the Server Address field enter:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>
nfs://192.168.1.250/mnt/store
</strong>
</pre></div><p>The address is made up of 3 parts. First is<code class="literal"> nfs://</code>, which tells OS X that we want to talk via NFS. Then comes the address of the FreeNAS server (192.168.1.250, change this accordingly) and finally, the resource to which we want to connect. All the disks are exported as /mnt/name. In this case, the name is store as we previously defined 
<em>store</em> in Disks: Mount Point: Management. Once mounted, it will appear under SHARED in the Finder on the left-hand side.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec11"/>Mount FreeNAS via NFS on Linux</h2></div></div></div><p>The particular Linux distribution you are using may have a graphical to mount NFS shares, but the lowest common denominator that works for all Linux versions is to use the command line.<a id="id137" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>To mount the FreeNAS server via NFS is easy and also mostly the same as in OS X, but rather than entering the command in the GUI, it is entered at the command line. In Linux, to mount any type of device, remote or local, you need to have a mount point, a place to peg the mounted resource. So open a terminal window and become root (usually with the 
<em>su</em> command, or alternatively you can prefix <em>sudo</em> in front of the following commands).</p><p>First, you need to change directory to the /mnt directory:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong># cd /mnt
</strong>
</pre></div><p>Now create a directory to peg the FreeNAS server to:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong># mkdir freenas
</strong>
</pre></div><p>And now mount the FreeNAS server:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong># mount 192.168.1.250:/mnt/store /mnt/freenas
</strong>
</pre></div><p>Once completed, all the files and folders on the disk <em>store</em> on the FreeNAS server will appear under<code class="literal"> /mnt/freenas</code>. So using earlier examples, you will find the Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 at<code class="literal"> /mnt/freenas/W2KSP4_EN.EXE</code>, not that it would be much good here!</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec05"/>RSYNCD, Unison, AFP, and UPnP</h1></div></div></div><p>CIFS, NFS, and FTP are the 3 main file access protocols for FreeNAS, however, FreeNAS doesn't stop there, it has another 4 protocols for different specialized tasks including backups and streaming multimedia.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec12"/>Using RSYNC for Backups</h2></div></div></div><p>RSYNC copies files between machines in an efficient manner and is therefore excellent for making backups. The RSYNC protocol allows RSYNC to transfer just the differences between two sets of files across the network connection, using an efficient algorithm. RSYNC is a client/server system meaning that a server is running to receive the backup file and a client sends the files from the local machine. For FreeNAS, this means that the RSYNC service can be configured and computers on your network can be backed up to it using an RSYNC client.<a id="id138" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>To enable the RSYNC service, tick the Enable box on the Services:<strong> RSYNCD: Server</strong> page. The other parameters you can leave at their defaults.<a id="id139" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>RSYNC is essentially a command line tool with a Linux/UNIX background, however, there are some Windows programs for handling backups via RSYNC. For more information, visit the websites:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>DeltaCopy (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp">http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp</a>)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>NasBackup (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.nasbackup.com">http://www.nasbackup.com</a>)</p></li></ul></div><p>Both of these tools are open source and free to download and use without restriction.</p><p>From the Linux (or OS X) command line, you can start a backup of files on the local machine like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>rsync -a /home/user/backup rsync://192.168.1.250/store
</strong>
</pre></div><p>This will backup the directory<code class="literal"> /home/user/backup</code> to the FreeNAS onto the store disk. The<code class="literal"> -a</code> parameter put RSYNC into archive mode, which means that any subdirectories will also be copied while preserving time stamps.</p><p>As before, you need to change the IP address (192.168.1.250) to the IP address of your FreeNAS server.</p><div><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>FreeNAS can also act as a RSYNC client, which means it send files from the server to another server and so, allowing the FreeNAS server to be backed up. We will look at this in more detail in chapter 7.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec13"/>Using Unison for Backups and Synchronization</h2></div></div></div><p>Unison is a file-synchronization tool for UNIX and Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then brought up-to-date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other. It is similar to RSYNC in that it can perform mirroring/synchronization of two directories, but unlike RSYNC, Unison can deal with updates to both copies of a distributed directory structure. Updates that do not conflict are propagated automatically. Conflicting updates are detected and displayed. Unison is open source and is published under the GNU Public License.<a id="id140" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>To enable the Unison service, go to<strong> Services: Unison</strong> and tick the Enable box. You need to choose which share the unison service will use and you can probably leave the other settings to their defaults.</p><p>For Unison to work, the Secure Shell (SSH) must be enabled (Services: SSH) and the user must have shell access enabled (Access: Users).</p><p>SSH and user administration are covered in detail in the next chapter.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec14"/>Connecting to FreeNAS via AFP</h2></div></div></div><p>Like CIFS for Windows and NFS for UNIX, Apple also have a file system protocol called AFP (Apple Filing Protocol). It allows Apple Macs to connect natively to the FreeNAS server. As with CIFS, the Mac will automatically discover any AFP services offered on the local area network. The AFP service will appear in the<strong> SHARED</strong> section in the Finder.<a id="id141" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><img src="img/4688_04_11.jpg" alt="Connecting to FreeNAS via AFP"/></div><p>To enable AFP, go to the<strong> Services: AFP</strong> page, and tick the Enable box. Now tick the<strong> Enable guest access</strong> box and click<strong> Save and Restart</strong>. The local authentication method will be looked at in the next chapter along with all other user management issues. AFP will now be running.

It is popular for easily enabling the streaming of multimedia data from a server to a client. In the FreeNAS context, UPnP allows a previously configured directory to be made available to a UPnP multimedia client such as a wireless media center that attaches to your TV. The UPnP client will find the FreeNAS server via the UPnP protocols and play (via a selection menu) the multimedia files stored in the FreeNAS server.<a id="id143" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>To enable UPnP, go to the<strong> Services: UPnP</strong> page and tick the Enable box.</p><p>You can leave the name and the network interface at their defaults.</p><p>Now, you need to add which disks you would like to share on the FreeNAS server. Clicking the add circle will bring up the familiar window for selecting which disks to share. In our test setup, we need to share<strong> /mnt/store</strong>. Enter this and the click<strong> Add</strong>.</p><p>Finally, click<strong> Save and Restart</strong>.</p><p>There are also a few parameters that can be changed:<a id="id144" class="indexterm"/>

GeeXboX is a free Linux distribution that turns a computer into a Home Theater PC or Media Center. It is a standalone LiveCD-based distribution, meaning it boots from the CD and runs out of the box on any modern PC. It can even be used on a diskless computer, as the whole system is loaded in RAM. Much like FreeNAS, you need to download the<code class="literal"> .ISO</code> image file and burn it onto a CD and then boot the PC from the CD.</p><p>Once booted, you can select<strong> Open</strong> from the main menu followed by<strong> Open File...</strong> and then choose the UPNP option and finally, the FreeNAS server.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec06"/>iSCSI Target</h1></div></div></div><p>iSCSI is an evolution of the SCSI protocol, which allows SCSI commands to be sent over a network. It allows two hosts to negotiate and then exchange SCSI commands using IP networks. The result is that a remote device with iSCSI capabilities can be seen to be a local disk drive but the commands and data for that device are being sent over the network rather than down a cable in the machine.<a id="id145" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>FreeNAS can be configured to be an iSCSI target, this means it acts as a remote SCSI disk and it can receive SCSI commands and apply them to a local disk. Once configured, an iSCSI initiator can connect to the FreeNAS iSCSI target and use the designated disk as a local disk.</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note13"/>Note</h3><p>To use the iSCSI functionality of FreeNAS, your server needs to have a minimum of 256MB of RAM.</p></div><p>iSCSI configuration starts on the<strong> Services: iSCSI Target</strong> page. An iSCSI target is formed from one of two things: an extent (the actual storage file or hard disk) or a device (a combination of other extents or devices in a RAID 0 or RAID 1 configuration). Therefore, there are a few steps to configuring a iSCSI target:<a id="id146" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>1. First, an extent needs to be created or defined.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>2. Optionally, a device can be configured.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>3. Finally, the target needs to be defined using information about the extent or device.</p></li></ol></div><p>Extent in this context means the device or file that will ultimately act as the iSCSI device. From the iSCSI Target page, click the add circle for extent section. Here, you need to enter two things: the name which by default is<strong> extent0</strong>, and then the path to the extent. Here, you can choose a device like<strong> /dev/ad0</strong> or a file. For this example I will choose a file as this offers the greatest flexibility in that the same physical disk can be used to host several iSCSI targets (note however, that you get greater performance when using a whole device). The name for the file is in the format<strong> /mnt/sharename/extentname</strong> so in this example it will be<strong> /mnt/store/extent0</strong>. Finally, put in a size, in megabytes, for example 2048 for 2 gigabytes.<a id="id147" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>If you wish to combine several extents or devices, then next, you can create a device. This is an optional step and isn't required if you are using a single extent (whether a file or hard disk). Click the add circle for the device section. You need to enter a device name which by default is<strong> device0</strong>. Next, select how you want to combine the extents (either with RAID 0 or RAID 1, see chapter 3 for more information on RAID).</p><p>Finally, you need to define the iSCSI target itself. Click on the add circle for the target section. Enter a target name, the default is<strong> target0</strong>. Then tick the extent that makes up the target, in this case<strong> extent0</strong>. You also need to configure the authorized networks that can access this iSCSI target. This is similar to the way in which NFS networks are authorized.</p><p>iSCSI disks behave in exactly the same way as local disks in that you can only have one computer controlling that disk. Therefore, it is important to ensure that only one iSCSI initiator uses any particular iSCSI target. If two (or more) iSCSI initiators use an iSCSI target, there will be data corruption.</p><p>One way to ensure that only one iSCSI initiator is using the iSCSI target is to limit the authorized network to just one IP address. If my iSCSI initiator has an IP address of 192.168.1.100, then entering that address along with 32 from the drop down box will limit iSCSI connections to just that IP address.</p><p>However, if your iSCSI initiator doesn't have a fixed IP address (and is using DHCP), then you won't be able to permanently set the IP address. In this case, you can only limit the IP address to a range of addresses on your network. Assuming your FreeNAS server has a netmask of 255.255.255.0, enter the first 3 numbers of the IP address of the FreeNAS server (with . in between) and then finish it with dot zero (.0). For example, if the IP address of the FreeNAS server is 192.168.1.250, then you would enter 192.168.1.0 for the authorized network. Finally, select 24 (in other words 255.255.255.0) in the drop down box.<a id="id148" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Once you have done this, apply the changes. The FreeNAS server will now create the 2GB file<strong> extent0 in /mnt/store</strong> and make the iSCSI target available on the network.</p><p>You will need to note the target name that is displayed as you will need this for the iSCSI initiator.</p><div><img src="img/4688_04_12.jpg" alt="iSCSI Target"/></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec16"/>Testing the iSCSI Target with Another FreeNAS Server</h2></div></div></div><p>To test the iSCSI target, we can get another FreeNAS server and connect it to the iSCSI disk on the iSCSI target FreeNAS server and see how the disk is used. To avoid confusion, I shall refer to the FreeNAS server where the iSCSI target is defined as the FreeNAS target server, and the server that will mount the remote iSCSI disk as the FreeNAS initiator server.<a id="id149" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip48"/>Note</h3><p><strong>Only One FreeNAS Server Available</strong></p><p>If you only have access to one FreeNAS server, you can still perform this test by using the same FreeNAS server.

This isn't very practical but it proves that you have iSCSI working.</p></div><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>1. On the FreeNAS initiator server, go to the<strong> Disks: Management</strong> page and click on the iSCSI Initiator tab. Now click the add circle.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>2. Enter a name for the iSCSI disk, say iSCSI0. It isn't too important as it for information only (it is not using during iSCSI negotiation).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>3. For the initiator name, enter:<strong> iqn.1994-04.org.netbsd.iscsi-initiator:freenas</strong>.</p><p>These names do have a special format (see below) but the most important aspect is that they are unique. For uniqueness, you can vary the part after the last colon, <strong>freenas2</strong> etc.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>4.

Finally, enter the IP address of the FreeNAS target server. And then click<strong> Add</strong>.</p></li></ol></div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note14"/>Note</h3><p>iSCSI names may seem long and complicated but it is possible to understand them. They are technically called iSCSI Qualified Names or IQNs for short and they all start with the letters iqn.</p><p>Here is a reminder of the target name:</p><p>
<strong>iqn.1994-04.org.netbsd.iscsi-initiator:freenas</strong>
</p><p>After<strong> iqn</strong>. comes a date code specifying the year and month in which the organization registered the domain, here it is April 1994.</p><p>Then comes the domain name which is backwards:<strong> iscsi-initiator.netbsd.org</strong>
</p><p>NetBSD is a sister project to FreeBSD, and the iSCSI parts of FreeBSD come from NetBSD, so their domain name is used.</p><p>Finally, there is a<strong> :</strong> and a local defined string to make sure the address is unique, in this case,<strong> freenas</strong>, which was the name of the target server.</p><p>If you have many iSCSI targets and initiators, you might consider using the last number of the IP address along with the word freenas to make unique names, e.g. freenas-250.</p></div><p>If you get any errors, try looking at the logs pages for clues to what went wrong:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>

This is because iSCSI disks are low level devices and the operating system that initiated the connection sees the iSCSI as if it were a normal hard disk in the system. This means it can be partitioned, formatted, and used like any local other disk.</p></div><div><img src="img/4688_04_Graphics.jpg" alt="Testing the iSCSI Target with Another FreeNAS Server"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec17"/>Testing the iSCSI Target with Windows Vista</h2></div></div></div><p>Microsoft Windows Vista comes with some built-in iSCSI initiator software (and it is also available as a separate download for Windows XP from the Microsoft website).
