<em>VMware View 5 Desktop Virtualization Solutions</em> is meant as a guide for architects, solution providers, consultants, engineers, and anyone planning to design and implement a solution based on VMware View 5. It will refer to real-world scenarios as they are likely the best teaching examples. It will explain the settings and configurations needed to have a successful solution as well as the reason behind the decisions.</p><p>This book is not meant to replace the official administration or installation guides for VMware View published by the great people at VMware. The administration and installation guides are used during the installation and implementation of the solution. The material in this book should be used during the design phase, which is before an implementation is underway.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>The driving factors of VDI</h1></div></div></div><p>Many agencies and organizations are looking at how to deliver desktops as a managed service while increasing end-point security and decreasing associated costs. Popular reasons to implement a VMware View solution include:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Security:</strong> VDI removes sensitive data from the end device and improves the ability to manage, secure, patch, and audit large numbers of desktop resources.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Windows 7 migrations:</strong> Organizations looking to migrate to Windows 7 are looking at VDI to ease the transition.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Technology/Hardware refresh:</strong> The daunting task of replacing outdated PCs during a hardware refresh can incur significant operational costs and reduce productivity. This is an opportunistic time to migrate users to a VDI solution; in addition, existing PCs could be repurposed as thin or thick clients, extending their usable life.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Energy reduction:</strong> Some VDI solutions can consume significantly less energy through the use of zero/thin clients and tailored hardware on the backend.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Device independence:</strong> VDI can remove the limitations of maintaining a stringent, "Acceptable Client List" for an organization (for example, Dell Latitude 5400S and Mac Books only) and instead allow the end user community to use their preferred device that ultimately connects back into a managed VDI. As long as the device has a support View Client, it is permitted for use within the organization. This is often called,<strong> Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)</strong>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Remote connectivity in times of crisis:</strong> Whether it's H1N1, an erupting volcano, mega-blizzard, or a swarm of locusts, VDI can allow workers to still work when they can't physically get to their work area.</li></ul></div><p>No matter the driving reason, VDI is a technology that has gained a lot of traction across many verticals all over the world. It's also likely that many server virtualization architects will be asked to include a VDI as part of their overall virtualized datacenter solution.</p></div></div>

<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Redundancy">Chapter 7</a>,<em> Redundancy</em>, focuses on building a robust and resilient VDI solution. It also explains how full redundancy can be designed and delivered, as well as design considerations and overall environmental impact.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Sizing the Storage">Chapter 8</a>,<em> Sizing the Storage</em>, focuses on one of the most complex components of VDI design, the underlying storage environment. It also covers both high-level and in-depth technical considerations, and design aspects of the storage system supporting the VDI.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Security">Chapter 9</a>,<em> Security</em>, focuses on hardening of the VDI as well as robust authentication mechanisms. It also discusses security considerations for specific environments, such as government agencies.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Migrating from Physical Desktops to Virtual Desktops">Chapter 10</a>,<em> Migrating from Physical Desktops to Virtual Desktops</em>, discusses techniques to successfully migrate a user base from a physical desktop to a virtual desktop.
