- en: If I had to take a wild guess, I'd say that you are reading these lines because,
    like me, you spend quite some time dealing with Unix systems. Be it because your
    job requires you to, or you simply love to poke around an operating system's internals,
    the shell is arguably how you deal with most of your activities.

- en: Historically, shells were conceived for speeding up our work, but we all know
    that at some point, what was supposed to be a leaner way to get things done turned
    into a slugfest of arcane symbols and impossibly long-to-remember lines of code.

- en: Wouldn't it be great then, if we could squeeze just a bit more out of our system?
    Imagine the things you are currently doing and being able to do them in a more
    efficient, elegant way, even the things that you thought were some sort of magic
    that only Linux's wizards with centuries' worth of experience were able to perform.

- en: What if I told you that feats such as knowing which option flags are available
    to a program no longer require you to scan endless screens of manpages? Imagine
    not having to deal with journeys along infinite horizontal lines of characters
    anymore. And what about relying on automatic completion instead of typing the
    same lines again? What if knowing which directory you are currently working on
    merely required you to stare at your command prompt? Now imagine that all it takes
    for getting started with all of this only demands you to switch to a new shell.

- en: Before getting started, you should be comfortable in handling a terminal emulator.
    Most operating systems bundle such software within their stock set of applications,
    but as is the case with any application, there are other offerings out there waiting
    to be discovered. Such alternatives are probably even better suited for the task
    at hand, so please make sure you get to know the ins and outs of your weapon of
    choice and its quirks before jumping into this book.

    code management system. It can be easily obtained and installed by following the
    instructions provided at [http://git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com), and it's an
