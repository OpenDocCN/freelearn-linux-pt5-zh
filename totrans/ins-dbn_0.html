<html><head></head><body><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref09"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>APT, one of the technologies that made Debian (and its derivatives, such as Ubuntu) highly popular, became mainstream for production deployments during the same time span that web applications broke through the barriers of enterprise fitness, reliability, and scalability.</p><p>The flexibility of Debian systems makes it very appealing for web DevOps and modern web apps. This book tries to simplify deployment and reduce time-to-market, while providing a solid foundation for you to grow your Debian sysadmin practices.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>In the first part of the book we’ll help you choose the right flavor of Debian, install it, and prepare for multiple and massive installations, should you need it. We will also guide you through the initial APT setup, installing the stack, and configuring storage and frameworks.</p><p>In the second part of the book, we harden the installation, analyze scalability paths, and learn how to effectively maintain your system, including backup/restore and performance. We also provide a future look at cloud and incident response, which will help you get the most out of your installation in the long run.</p><p>

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>You need hardware, either a server or hypervisor software that supports Linux-based operating systems to install Debian. You should plan for at least 2 GB of disk space, and additional space for your database and application, including static files. You also need a broadband Internet connection to download the installation media as well as any additional software packages.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>Readers should be familiar with the essential concepts of the Linux system’s administration, such as how to work with files and permissions, command line instructions, and how service and processes work in Linux, although the chapters are not technically demanding. While the book does not require previous knowledge on the APT system, it does expect readers to understand how the particular configuration files for the services Apache, Nginx, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and so on, work.</p></div>
