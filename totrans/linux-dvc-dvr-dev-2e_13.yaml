    makes every memory address virtual, which means they do not point to any address
    in the RAM directly. This way, whenever we access a memory location, a translation
    mechanism is performed in order to match the corresponding physical memory.

    as a reference to access the physical memory location by CPU on behalf of the
    **Memory Management Unit** (**MMU**). The MMU sits between the CPU core and memory
    and is most often part of the physical CPU itself. That said, on ARM architectures,
    it's part of the licensed core. It is then responsible for converting virtual
    addresses into physical addresses every time memory locations are accessed. This
    mechanism is called **address translation**.

    from a mapping above `PAGE_OFFSET`. Such addresses are virtual addresses with
    a fixed offset from their physical addresses. Thus, a logical address is always
    a virtual address, and the reverse is not true.

    all possible addresses for a computational entity (in our case, the CPU). This
    address space may be virtual or physical. While physical address space can go
    up to the amount of RAM installed on the system (theoretically limited by the
    width of the CPU address bus and registers), the range of virtual addresses can
    extend to the highest address permitted by the RAM or by the operating system
    architecture (such as addressing up to 4 GB of virtual memory on a 1 GB RAM system).

    **Page Frame Number** (**PFN**).

    process and even the kernel itself (and some devices) is allocated address space,
    which is some portion of the processor's virtual address space (note that neither
    the kernel nor processes deal with physical addresses – only MMU does). While

    part is used for the kernel and the lower part is used for user space.

    the lower 3 GB of virtual address space. The kernel can, however, be given a different
    amount of address space as desired by playing with the `CONFIG_VMSPLIT_1G`, `CONFIG_VMSPLIT_2G`,
    and `CONFIG_VMSPLIT_3G_OPT` kernel configuration options (see `arch/x86/Kconfig`

    Kernel virtual addresses are similar to logical addresses in that they are mappings
    from a kernel-space address to a physical address. However, the difference is

    Let's see why. Most 32-bit architectures require 32 bits (4 bytes) to represent
    a page table entry. On such systems (32-bit) where each process has its private
    3 GB user address space, we need 786,432 entries to characterize and cover a process's
    address space. It represents too much physical memory spent per process just to
    store the memory mappings. In fact, a process generally uses a small but scattered
    portion of its virtual address space. To resolve that issue, the concept of a
    "level" was introduced. Page tables are hierarchized by level (page level). The
    space necessary to store a multi-level page table only depends on the virtual
    address space actually in use, instead of being proportional to the maximum size
    of the virtual address space. This way, unused memory is no longer represented,
    and the page table walk-through time is reduced. Moreover, each table entry in
    level `N` will point to an entry in the table of level `N+1`, level 1 being the
    higher level.

    the process's level-1 page table (PGD), and then it uses the level-1 index, extracted
    from the **Most-Significant Bits** (**MSBs**) of the virtual address to find the
    appropriate table entry, which contains a pointer to the base address of the appropriate
    level-2 page table. Then, from that base address, it uses the level-2 index to
    find the appropriate entry and so on, until it reaches the PTE. ARM architecture
    (i.MX6, in our case) has a two-level page table. In this case, the level-2 entry
    is a PTE and points to the physical page (PFN). Only the physical page is found
    at this step. To access the exact memory location in the page, the MMU extracts
    the memory offset, also part of the virtual address, and points to the same offset

    process's page table to find the right entry (PTE). The virtual page number is
    extracted (from the virtual address) and used by the processor as an index into
    the process's page table to retrieve its page table entry. If there is a valid
    page table entry at that offset, the processor takes the page frame number from
    this entry. If not, it means the process accessed an unmapped area of its virtual
    memory. A page fault is then raised, and the OS should handle it.

    TLB speeds up virtual address translation (yes, address translation is a time-consuming
    task). It is a **Content-Addressable Memory** (**CAM**), where the key is the
    virtual address and the value is the physical address. In other words, the TLB

    just keeps running and uses the PFN found in the TLB entry to calculate the target
    physical address. There is no page fault when a TLB hit occurs. If a translation

    or from high memory to a low memory region (from kernel to kernel space). The
    common case is remapping the kernel memory to user space, but there are other
    cases, such as when we need to access high memory.

- en: The Linux kernel permanently maps 896 MB of its address space to the lower 896
    MB of the physical memory (low memory). On a 4 GB system, there is only 128 MB
    left to the kernel to map the remaining 3.2 GB of physical memory (high memory).
    However, low memory is directly addressable by the kernel because of the permanent
    and one-to-one mapping. When it comes to high memory (memory preceding 896 MB),
    the kernel has to map the requested region of high memory into its address space,
    and the 128 MB mentioned previously is especially reserved for this. The function
    used to perform this trick is `kmap()`. The `kmap()` function is used to map a
    given page into the kernel address space.

    at the heart of these implementations. However, `kmap()` maps pages into kernel
    space using a physically contiguous set of page tables allocated during the boot.
    Because the page tables are all connected, it''s simple to move around without
    having to consult the page directory all the time. You should note that the `kmap`
    page tables correspond to kernel virtual addresses beginning with `PKMAP BASE`,
    which differs per architecture, and the reference count for its page table entries
    is kept in a separate array called `pkmap_count`.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The page frame of the page to map into kernel space is passed to `kmap()` as
    a `struct *page` argument, and this can be a regular or `HIGHMEM` page; in the
    first case, `kmap()` simply returns the direct-mapped address. For `HIGHMEM` pages,
    `kmap()` searches through the `kmap` page tables (which were allocated at boot
    time) for an unused entry – that is, an entry whose `pkmap_count` value is zero.
    If there are none, it goes to sleep and waits for another process to `kunmap`
    a page. When it finds an unused one, it inserts the physical page address of the
    page we want to map, incrementing at the same time the `pkmap_count` reference
    count corresponding to the page table entry, and returns the virtual address to
    the caller. The `page->virtual` for the page struct is also updated to reflect
    the mapped address.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After invoking the `mmap()` system call on a file descriptor (a device-backed
    file or not) given a region start and length, the CPU will switch to privileged
    mode. An initial kernel code will create an almost empty VMA as large as the requested
    mapping region and will run the corresponding `file_operations.mmap` callback,
    giving the VMA as a parameter. In turn, this callback should call `remap_pfn_range()`.
    This function will update the VMA and will derive the kernel's PTE of the mapped
    region before adding it to the process's page table, with different protection
    flags of course. The process's VMA list will be updated with the insertion of
    the VMA entry (with appropriate attributes), which will use the derived PTE to
    access the same memory. This way, the kernel and user space will both point to
    the same physical memory region, each through their own page tables but with different
    protection flags. Thus, instead of wasting memory and CPU cycles by copying, the
    kernel just duplicates the PTEs, each with their own attributes.
