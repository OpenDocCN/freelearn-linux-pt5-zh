- en: Now that you have data on your FreeNAS server and you can access it from your
    PC, Mac, Linux or UPnP device, it is time to think about backup. In this chapter,
    we shall explore the different options that exist to back up the data on the FreeNAS
    server including using RSYNC to a second local disk as well as to a remote machine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From one point of view, the fact that the FreeNAS server has no support for
    tape or optical disk (DVD or Blu-ray) backup is a weakness. But from another point
    of view, this is normal as the nature of Network Attached Storage is that it is
    accessible from the network. All operations including configuration, management,
    and data access occur over the network. As such, backup is also performed over
    the network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two mains strategies for performing a network-based backup. The first
    is to initiate a backup directly to tape, compressed file archive (like ZIP or
    compressed tar) or even optical disk from a remote server or workstation. Here,
    the data is pulled from the FreeNAS server (via CIFS, NFS or AFP) and written
    to the backup store (tape, hard drive or optical store). The second option is
    to copy the data, internally, inside the FreeNAS server. Here, the data remains
    on the FreeNAS server but is stored on a second disk or RAID set.

    FreeNAS has an option to use RSYNC to synchronize data from one hard disk to another
    inside the same FreeNAS server. This is known as local RSYNC synchronization and
    to use it, you need at least two hard disks or RAID sets (the source and the destination),

- en: If you use RSYNC (or RAID), do you need to make other types of backup? This
    is an important question and the simple answer is yes, you do. The primary gain
    of using RAID or mirrored backups (via RSYNC) is that you are protected from hardware
    failure. In the RAID scenario, if a disk fails, the server continues and after
    the disk is replaced, the system continues as before and no data is lost. When
    mirroring the data on another server, if the primary server fails, the data is
    intact on the other server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'However, RAID and RSYNC don''t protect you from human error. The scenario goes
    like this: you have an important document that someone manages to delete. The
    only copy of that document was on the FreeNAS server. If you are using RAID, then
    the file has been deleted on all the disks in the RAID set at the moment it was
    deleted. If you are using mirroring, then you have a small window until the mirrored
    copy will also be deleted. There is no history with these types of backups, no
    way to go back in time to find a certain version of a file or a file that was
    deleted.'

    backup is made, the tape or disk can be stored on a shelf (or better still in

    be there along with the data on it (assuming you verified the backup when it was
    made).

    of offline backup to tape or disk similar to the procedure described in the section
    *Backup your FreeNAS using Windows XP's built-in Backup utility* earlier in this
