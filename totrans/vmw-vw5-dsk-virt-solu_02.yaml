    drivers, including cost reduction, increased security, or end device flexibility.
    When participating in a VDI endeavor, it is important to define the project success
    criteria. For example, if an organization is looking to decrease the login time
    for roaming physicians, it is important to incorporate a streamlined login process
    (for example, Single Sign-On) into the overall solution.

- en: Also, for solution providers and architects that are designing VMware View solutions
    for multiple organizations, it is important to take a scientific and organized
    approach for designing View solutions. Designing the solutions for separate organizations
    in tandem can be very confusing. By taking the same approach to each project,
    the VDI architect can minimize errors and, more importantly, streamline the amount
    of effort required to produce a design.

    of VMware View*, this book focuses on designing the solutions based on VMware
    View 5\. In a full solution, there would be an implementation phase, which would
    follow the validation phase. These phases, which would include subtopics such
    as defining the project timeline, key milestones, handoff, and operational readiness
    would also be incorporated. Nevertheless, these topics are outside the scope of

    number of MHz needed by a given user. Two key CPU-related metrics are CPU Ready
    and CPU Wait. **CPU Ready** is the time in milliseconds that a machine spends
    waiting for a CPU to become available. If the design implements too many vDesktops
    per core, the end users will experience a high CPU Ready time and their vDesktops
    will be sluggish as the vDesktops wait for one another to free up the CPU time
    for their own processing needs. **CPU Wait** is the time in milliseconds that
    a CPU spends waiting for an I/O to complete. A high CPU Wait is usually indicative
    of either a disk or a network bottleneck. For example, a particular vDesktop may
    be running a process that reads and writes the large amount of data to the local
    filesystem. If the underlying storage is unable to meet the performance needs
    of the vDesktop's process, a high CPU Wait time may be realized.

    storm and login storm terms will appear often; however, the two terms cannot be
    used interchangeably.

- en: A **boot storm** is a significant enough number of vDesktops booting (or resuming
    from a suspension) to cause a decrease in the overall VDI performance. This can
    be caused due to one or more data stores that are unable to handle the I/O load,
    a file lock conflict with too many vDesktops/data stores, a DHCP lease request
    flood, and so on.

- en: A **login storm** is a significant enough number of end users logging into the
    vDesktops to cause a decrease in the overall VDI performance. This can be caused
    due to creating initial profiles, streaming a user's persona, slow Active Directory
    performance, misaligned disks (for example, Windows XP without the proper offset),
    and so on.

    Stratusphere UX (User Experience) or RTO PinPoint can allow a VMware View architect
    to identify bottlenecks during the validation phase instead of during the implementation
    phase.

    random) series of tailored tests, the tests can become the control in an experiment

    10) are needed to be quantified, a saved RAWC test could be run against a desktop
    pool using EFD in the first iteration and SCSI 15K in the second iteration.

- en: VDI solution design is complex; by taking a measured approach that involves
    both hard data (metric collection) as well as organizational input (questionnaire),
    the chances of a suitable design increase drastically. This chapter discussed
    the layers involved in a VMware View solution, some of the pitfalls to watch out
    for, as well as some of the industry tools to use to help support the overall
    design and validation process.

- en: The next chapter discusses one of the most important design considerations a
    VDI architect can make, *persistent or non-persistent?* The answer to this question
    is the cornerstone of the VMware View design, and, as such, needs to be fully
    understood to ensure the best possible design outcome.
