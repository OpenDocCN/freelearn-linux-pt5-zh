The chapter is not just about executing a wizard by clicking on next, next, and finish, you'll also learn how to configure the computer that will run VMware Workstation wisely and perform an advanced installation on either Windows or Linux.</p><div class="section" title="Configuring the host computer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Configuring the host computer</h1></div></div></div><p>Before starting the<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/> installation of <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>VMware Workstation, you should take care of the host computer on which you want to use VMware Workstation. Sure, any computer that meets the minimal requirements will work, but if you choose the appropriate configuration, you'll benefit more from your VMware Workstation installation. In this section, we'll spend a few words on using the most appropriate configuration for your computer.</p><div class="section" title="CPU and CPU cores"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec05"/>CPU and CPU cores</h2></div></div></div><p>Every virtual machine <a id="id2" class="indexterm"/>that you'll install will work as a computer by itself, and the total number of CPU cores in your computer will be available as the maximum number of CPUs that you'll allocate to a virtual machine. However, if you want to get the best performance out of your virtual machines, it is a good idea to not configure more virtual CPUs than the total number of CPUs and CPU cores in your computer. This means that if you have four cores in total, ideally you shouldn't run more than three virtual machines with one core each at the same time. As the number of virtual CPUs that are in use gets higher than the total number of CPUs in your computer, CPUs must be shared, and that is not good for performance.</p><p>There is no formal number of CPU cores, so if you're on a budget for hardware, you can run VMware Workstation on a computer that has only one core. However for best possible performance, this is not recommended.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>Linux cgroups</strong></span></p><p>If you are running <a id="id3" class="indexterm"/>VMware Workstation on Linux, you can use cgroups. With cgroups, you can define groups of resources that make sure that every VM always has a dedicated amount of system resources available; a nice and efficient way to use the hardware in the best and most optimal way.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Memory"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec06"/>Memory</h2></div></div></div><p>If a computer runs out of physical <a id="id4" class="indexterm"/>RAM, it starts swapping to disk. Using VMware Workstation, you want to avoid your computer starting to swap at all times. To make sure this never happens, the total size of RAM in your computer must be more than the total amount of RAM in use by all the virtual machines, with an addition of 2 GB for the host operating system for smooth operation. This means that a typical computer that is going to be used for VMware Workstation will have at least 4 GB of RAM or more if possible. But if you're on a budget and want to create virtual machines that don't need much RAM, you can work with VMware Workstation on a minimal 1 GB of RAM.</p></div><div class="section" title="Disk space"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>Disk space</h2></div></div></div><p>A very important <a id="id5" class="indexterm"/>part of the configuration of the host system is the available disk space. Typically, each virtual machine needs a couple of gigabytes of available disk space; so a minimal configuration will need at least 10 GB of available disk space, whereas on a dedicated test machine that is going to run several virtual machines, you might need hundreds of gigabytes of free disk space.</p><p>If you're looking for good performance, just having the available disk space is not enough. This is because you don't want the virtual machine disk file to be fragmented. To avoid fragmentation, it is recommended that you use a machine where a separate disk is dedicated to the storage of VMDK files. The benefit of this that you can avoid fragmentation, and you'll have one disk that is dedicated to the operating system and another disk that is dedicated to handling virtual machine I/O requests.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Getting VMware Workstation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>Getting VMware Workstation</h1></div></div></div><p>To get <a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>VMware Workstation, you'll typically download it from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.vmware.com">www.vmware.com</a>. From the VMware site, you can either download a trial version or purchase VMware Workstation. Once you've got the VMware installation file and a registration code, you can start the installation. You can also create an account at the VMware site that allows you to easily access all of your previous purchases. In this section, you'll learn how to buy your own copy of VMware Workstation and how to access purchased<a id="id7" class="indexterm"/> products from your VMware account.</p><div class="section" title="Purchasing VMware Workstation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Purchasing VMware Workstation</h2></div></div></div><p>The following <a id="id8" class="indexterm"/>procedure describes how to get VMware Workstation:</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"/>Tip</h3><p><span class="strong"><strong>Support</strong></span></p><p>There is a supported version of VMware Workstation, but it is only available if you buy 10 licenses or more. If you're going to use VMware Workstation in a business environment and you want easy access to help, buy the supported version. VMware offers basic support that is 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday or business support that is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. When purchasing support, you can select a contract period of either one year or three years. If support is important for you, I recommend that you buy Production support. The price difference is small, and for this small difference you will have 24/7 support.</p></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Start a browser and go to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.vmware.com">www.vmware.com</a>.

<div class="section" title="Starting VMware Workstation for the first time"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec12"/>Starting VMware Workstation for the first time</h1></div></div></div><p>After installing it, you can <a id="id35" class="indexterm"/>start VMware Workstation for the first time. But before you can actually start creating the first virtual machine, there are a few steps that still need to be completed. First, you'll need to accept the license agreement. Once you've done that, you will see the VMware Workstation dashboard in which all of the common tasks that are performed in VMware Workstation are summarized. In the following screenshot, you can see what the dashboard looks like. In the next chapter, you'll learn how to continue and create your first virtual machine.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9182EN_01_03.jpg" alt="Starting VMware Workstation for the first time"/><div class="caption"><p>The VMware Workstation dashboard</p></div></div><p>Before you start creating your first virtual machine, there are a few VMware Workstation settings that you might want to change. To access these settings, either click on <span class="strong"><strong>Workstation Preferences</strong></span> or open the <span class="strong"><strong>Edit</strong></span> menu and select <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span>.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> <a id="id36" class="indexterm"/>option allows you to set preferences for different features; some of them are self-explanatory. In this section, you'll just read about the most interesting settings. An important feature that you'll find under the <span class="strong"><strong>Workspace</strong></span> option is <span class="strong"><strong>Default hardware compatibility</strong></span>. This option is normally set to the most recent version of VMware Workstation. If, however, you plan on exchanging virtual machines with users of previous versions frequently, you might want to change this to an earlier version. Another important option that you'll find here is ESX Server compatibility. If you plan to upload virtual machines to ESX Server, make sure that <span class="strong"><strong>Compatible with ESX Server</strong></span> is selected. Without this option selected, you won't be able to upload virtual machines to an ESX environment.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9182EN_01_06.jpg" alt="Starting VMware Workstation for the first time"/><div class="caption"><p>On the Workspace Preferences window, you'll define the compatibility for the VMs you create</p></div></div><p>To define special key<a id="id37" class="indexterm"/> combinations that you can use for commonly used virtual machine operations, you can use the <span class="strong"><strong>Hot Keys</strong></span> tab. On this tab, for instance, you'll define which keys you'll use to release control from a virtual machine and get back to the host environment. By default, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> keys are used for this purpose. On some operating systems, this key already has a different meaning; on Linux, for instance, you use it to open different virtual consoles. If you want to keep this functionality, you can define another hotkey sequence.</p><p>An important part of the configuration of your VMware Workstation host is the amount of RAM that you'll make available for the use of the virtual machines. On one hand, you need to make sure that there is enough RAM remaining to keep the host operating system running smoothly. On the other hand, you also want to make sure that you have enough RAM to allocate the needs of all of your virtual machines. If you don't have sufficient RAM for the host operating system, it will start swapping, and if you don't have enough RAM for the virtual machines, the virtual machine memory will get swapped, neither of which is good for the performance of your computer.</p><p>Also under <span class="strong"><strong>Memory</strong></span>, you<a id="id38" class="indexterm"/> can specify how the swap is going to be used. The best option for good performance is to disallow the usage of the swap completely. To do this select <span class="strong"><strong>Fit all virtual memory into reserved host RAM</strong></span>, but this means that you might not be able to run all the virtual machines that you need on your host computer. The default option, which is selected, is <span class="strong"><strong>Allow some virtual machine memory to be swapped</strong></span>. This offers the best compromise between performance and the amount of virtual machines that you can run. If you want to be able to run as many virtual machines as possible on the available hardware at the host computer, select <span class="strong"><strong>Allow most virtual machine memory to be swapped</strong></span>; but be prepared for bad performance if you plan to run multiple virtual machines on your computer.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9182EN_01_07.jpg" alt="Starting VMware Workstation for the first time"/><div class="caption"><p>On the Memory tab, you can specify how the host operating system will manage system memory for your virtual machines</p></div></div><p>On the <span class="strong"><strong>Priority</strong></span> tab, you need to specify that a virtual machine should get extra priority if it is active. By default, there is no additional priority for the virtual machine even if it is active. If you want to speed up the virtual machine a bit while working on it, make sure that <span class="strong"><strong>High</strong></span> is selected on the <span class="strong"><strong>Input grabbed</strong></span> option. To make sure that the host works smoothly while no virtual machines are in use, make sure that the <span class="strong"><strong>Input ungrabbed</strong></span> option reads <span class="strong"><strong>Low</strong></span>.</p><p>Another performance-related<a id="id39" class="indexterm"/> option specifies how to deal with snapshots. The default options will run the snapshot process in the background irrespective of whether you are taking a snapshot or restoring a snapshot. However, running snapshots in the background ensures that changes are only applied when the virtual machine is off. If you want to apply changes directly, you will need to make sure that the snapshot program runs as a foreground job. This will, however, slow down other processes on your computer as the snapshot process is both heavy in I/O as well as in CPU usage.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9182EN_01_08.jpg" alt="Starting VMware Workstation for the first time"/><div class="caption"><p>Under the Priority option, you can optimize virtual machine performance a bit</p></div></div></div>
