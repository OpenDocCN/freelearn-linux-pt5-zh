- en: Most organizations will have a DR plan in place, regardless of whether it is
    a large enterprise or a small or medium business. VMware Site Recovery Manager
    leveraging an array-based replication is a very effective DR solution. However,
    an array-based replication can be a costly solution for some businesses, especially
    the small and medium businesses. VMware's proprietary replication engine called
    vSphere Replication offers a very cost-effective DR solution without the need
    for investments on storage replication technologies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the advantages for businesses using vSphere Replication is the fact that
    the replication can be managed without the need for an SRM license. The vSphere
    Web Client GUI provides an interface to configure and manage replication on virtual
    machines.

- en: vSphere Replication is a replication engine that can be leveraged to configure
    replication on individual virtual machines. It can replicate a virtual machine
    and its disks from one location to another without the need to incorporate an
    expensive array-based replication. What it really does is provide a mechanism
    to replicate a virtual machine using the existing Ethernet infrastructure and
    recover them when there is a need.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concept of vSphere Replication was introduced with VMware Site Recovery
    Manager Version 5.0\. At that time, vSphere Replication was not a standalone product.
    vSphere v5.1 onwards, vSphere Replication became a standalone product and directly
    integrates into the vSphere platform. It registers itself as a plugin to the vCenter
    Server. All of the replication and recovery operations are done using the vSphere
    Web Client. It is included in Essentials Plus and higher license models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is storage agnostic, which means that a virtual machine or its disk files
    can be replicated to a datastore, regardless of it being a VMFS volume or an NFS
    mount. For instance, if the virtual machine that you want to protect by enabling
    replication is located on a VMFS volume, then the replica can be either on another
    VMFS volume or an NFS mount. This stands true both ways.

    **vSphere Replication Appliance** (**VRA**). We will discuss more about the differences
    in the architecture section.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By standalone mode, we mean that the replication is managed without the use
    of **Site Recovery Manager** (**SRM**). Prior to Version 5.5, the number of VR
    appliances that can be deployed in the standalone mode were limited to only one
    and with SRM, it was 10\. Deploying multiple VRs can have several use cases. It
    is not mandatory to have a vCenter at a datacenter to deploy a VR appliance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A VR appliance can simply be deployed at a remote datacenter to handle the replication
    traffic sent to it and the writing of the data onto a chosen datastore at that
    site. This new ability drives several use cases. For instance, if you were to
    maintain a remote datacenter only to hold replicated data, then you don't necessarily
    have to deploy a vCenter Server at that site. You can manage the datacenter with
    an existing vCenter Server, and a VR appliance deployed on one of ESXi hosts at
    the remote site should do the job of collating the replication traffic and writing
    it onto the intended datastore.

    VMs. This is because if you were to reconfigure the VRMS component to use an external
    database, then you will lose the existing replication configuration information.
    You will need to reconfigure the replication on the VMs. Backup and restoration
    of an external database is easier because you will have to only back up the database
    files. If you were to plan a backup of the embedded database, then you will have

- en: Unlike with the vSphere Replication Appliances, you can deploy additional vSphere
    Replication Servers using an add-on appliance available in the vSphere Replication
    deployment bundle that was downloaded. You can deploy up to 10 VR Servers appliances
    per vCenter Server instance. There are several use cases to deploy additional
    VR Servers. One of the prime reasons is the manual load distribution. Each VR
    Server with the default memory configuration of 512 MB can handle up to 100 replications.
    If there are more than 100 VMs being replicated, then you could either choose
    to increase the memory of the appliance or deploy additional appliances and load
    balance by distributing the replication traffic to different appliances.
