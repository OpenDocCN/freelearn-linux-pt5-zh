    do that. Having done so, I could then control who can access each specific file.

    it can only add permissions to what's already there, or remove permissions from
    what's already there. If you need to ensure that all of the permissions for a
    particular file get set to a certain value, the symbolic method can get a bit
    unwieldy. And for shell scripting, forget about it. In a shell script, you'd need

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As useful as it may be to have SUID or SGID permissions on your executable files,
    we should consider it as just a necessary evil. While having SUID or SGID set
    on certain operating system files is essential for the operation of your Linux
    system, it becomes a security risk when users set SUID or SGID on other files.
    The problem is that, if intruders find an executable file that belongs to the
    root user and has the SUID bit set, they can use that to exploit the system. Before
    they leave, they might leave behind their own root-owned file with an SUID set,
    which will allow them to easily gain entry to the system the next time they encounter
    it. If the intruder's SUID file isn't found, the intruder will still have access,
    even if the original problem has been fixed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The numerical value for SUID is `4000`, and for SGID, it's `2000`. To set SUID
    on a file, you'd just add `4000` to whichever permissions value that you would
    set otherwise. For example, if you have a file with a permissions value of `755`,
    you'd set SUID by changing the permissions value to `4755`. (This would give you
    read/write/execute access for the user, read/execute for the group, and read/execute
    for others, with the SUID bit added on.)

    filename extensions you might look for include `.ini` and `.cfg`. Also, because

    of `-exec`.'

    shell from interpreting the semicolon incorrectly, we have to escape it with a
