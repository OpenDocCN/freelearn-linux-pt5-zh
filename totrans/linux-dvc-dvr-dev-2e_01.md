# Section 1 -Linux Kernel Development Basics

This section helps you make your first step into Linux kernel development. Here, we introduce the Linux kernel infrastructure (its structure and its build system), its compilation, and device driver development. As a mandatory step, we introduce the most used concepts kernel developers must know, such as sleeping, locking, basic work scheduling, and interrupt handling mechanisms. Last, we introduce the indispensable character device drivers, allowing interactions between kernel space and user space, via either standard system calls or an extended set of commands.
