VMware Site Recovery Manager leveraging an array-based replication is a very effective DR solution. However, an array-based replication can be a costly solution for some businesses, especially the small and medium businesses. VMware's proprietary replication engine called vSphere Replication offers a very cost-effective DR solution without the need for investments on storage replication technologies.</p><p>One of the advantages for businesses using vSphere Replication is the fact that the replication can be managed without the need for an SRM license. The vSphere Web Client GUI provides an interface to configure and manage replication on virtual machines.</p><p>In this chapter, we learn what vSphere Replication actually is, its architecture, and how it can be deployed in your vSphere environment.</p><p>vSphere Replication<a id="id173" class="indexterm"/> is a replication engine that can be leveraged to configure replication on individual virtual machines. It can replicate a virtual machine and its disks from one location to another without the need to incorporate an expensive array-based replication. What it really does is provide a mechanism to replicate a virtual machine using the existing Ethernet infrastructure and recover them when there is a need.</p><p>The concept of vSphere Replication was introduced with VMware Site Recovery Manager Version 5.0. At that time, vSphere Replication was not a standalone product. vSphere v5.1 onwards, vSphere Replication became a standalone product and directly integrates into the vSphere platform. It registers itself as a plugin to the vCenter Server. All of the replication and recovery operations are done using the vSphere Web Client. It is included in Essentials Plus and higher license models.</p><p>It is<a id="id174" class="indexterm"/> storage agnostic, which means that a virtual machine or its disk files can be replicated to a datastore, regardless of it being a VMFS volume or an NFS mount. For instance, if the virtual machine that you want to protect by enabling replication is located on a VMFS volume, then the replica can be either on another VMFS volume or an NFS mount. This stands true both ways.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"/>Note</h3><p>vSphere Replication can protect a maximum of 500 virtual machines.</p></div></div><p>VMware Site Recovery Manager can be configured to leverage the vSphere Replication engine to perform recovery tests, Failovers, Planned Migration, Failback, and so on.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec30"/>New features of vSphere Replication 5.5</h2></div></div></div><p>vSphere Replication was greatly improved with the release of the Version 5.5. Some <a id="id175" class="indexterm"/>of the new features and improvements are explored in the following sections.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec11"/>Multiple points-in-time replication snapshots (historical retention)</h3></div></div></div><p>You can now have multiple points-in-time snapshots (a maximum of 24 snapshots) of your replicated data. The number of snapshots and the retention period can be specified when configuring replication for a virtual machine.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec12"/>Multiple vSphere Replication Server appliances per vCenter</h3></div></div></div><p>With vSphere 5.5, you can now deploy up to 10 vSphere Replication Server appliances per vCenter in a standalone mode.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"/>Note</h3><p>Keep in mind that a <strong>vSphere Replication Server</strong> (<strong>VR Server</strong>) is not a <strong>vSphere Replication Appliance</strong> (<strong>VRA</strong>). We will discuss more about the differences in the architecture section.</p></div></div><p>By standalone mode, we mean that the replication is managed without the use of <strong>Site Recovery Manager</strong> (<strong>SRM</strong>). Prior to Version 5.5, the number of VR appliances that can be<a id="id176" class="indexterm"/> deployed in the standalone mode were limited to only one and with SRM, it was 10. Deploying multiple VRs can have several use cases. It is not mandatory to have a vCenter at a datacenter to deploy a VR appliance.</p><p>A VR appliance can simply be deployed at a remote datacenter to handle the replication traffic sent to it and the writing of the data onto a chosen datastore at that site. This new ability drives several use cases. For instance, if you were to maintain a remote datacenter only to hold replicated data, then you don't necessarily have to deploy a vCenter Server at that site. You can manage the datacenter with an existing vCenter Server, and a VR appliance<a id="id177" class="indexterm"/> deployed on one of ESXi hosts at the remote site should do the job of collating the replication traffic and writing it onto the intended datastore.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec13"/>Storage vMotion of protected VMs</h3></div></div></div><p>You now perform storage vMotion of a replicated, protected VM to any datastore. However, this can only be done with VMs at a protected site and not with the replicas at the recovery site. The replicas are not registered to any of the ESXi hosts at the target site.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec14"/>Storage profiles and vSAN compatibility</h3></div></div></div><p>VM storage profiles can now be used to with vSphere Replication. You can also now use vSphere Replication with vSAN, but there are several caveats. However, vSAN itself is an <a id="id178" class="indexterm"/>experimental feature with vSphere 5.5.</p><p>For more information regarding the use of vSphere Replication with vSAN, refer to page 51 <a id="id179" class="indexterm"/>of the vSphere Replication Administration guide at <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/VRAdminGuide">http://bit.ly/VRAdminGuide</a>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec15"/>Performance improvement</h3></div></div></div><p>VMware claims that the replication is now faster. It uses a new TCP stack optimization for latency handling. The following are the two aspects:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It implements buffered I/O for improved NFC write performance</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Disk blocks sent across are coalesced or aggregated, and it is only then the disk is opened for the <code class="literal">WRITE</code> operation to be performed</li></ul></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note08"/>Note</h3><p>There are several other improvements. For more information, read the What's New section of the vSphere Replication 5.5 Release Notes at <a class="ulink" href="http://bit.ly/VR_WhatIsNew">http://bit.ly/VR_WhatIsNew</a>.</p></div></div><p>This performance improvement, however, does not affect the stated RPO (which should be greater or equal to 15 minutes and less than or equal to 24 hours) for vSphere Replication. The performance improvement is for the data transfer and handling. This means<a id="id180" class="indexterm"/> it can now handle more replications, hence more data.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec31"/>Understanding the vSphere Replication architecture</h2></div></div></div><p>vSphere <a id="id181" class="indexterm"/>Replication is VMware's hypervisor-based replication solution. Unlike the array-based replication, the data is replicated over the network using the VMware <strong>Network File Copy</strong> (<strong>NFC</strong>) protocol. VMware NFC is a proprietary<a id="id182" class="indexterm"/> VMware protocol that is used to transfer disk (VMDK) blocks between ESXi hosts.</p><p>The vSphere Replication architecture involves the following components:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">One or more instances of vCenter Servers managing the protected and the recovery sites</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A <strong>vSphere Replication Appliance</strong> (<strong>VRA</strong>) deployed at the protected site</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A VRA or a vSphere Replication Server at the recovery site</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The VRM plugin for the vSphere Web Client</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The vSphere Replication agent that runs on every ESXi host</li></ul></div><p>A vSphere Replication Appliance is a vApp comprising of the <strong>vSphere Replication Management Server</strong> (<strong>VRMS</strong>) and a VR Server. For vSphere Replication to work, you will need a VRMS at the protected site and a VR Server at the target recovery site, be it local or remote; and there can be only one VRMS per vCenter Server. Refer to the following diagram:</p><div><img src="img/6442EN_01_29.jpg" alt="Understanding the vSphere Replication architecture"/></div><p>The recovery site is where you plan to maintain the replicas of the virtual machines from the protected site. It is the site to which you will be sending the replication traffic. The vSphere Replication Appliances provides a replication management interface via the vSphere <a id="id183" class="indexterm"/>Web Client. It registers itself as a plugin for the vSphere Web Client.</p><p>Every ESXi host starting with Version 5.1 has a vSphere Replication agent already built into the VMkernel, thereby removing the dependency on Site Recovery Manager and installing additional packages into each ESXi host.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec28"/>Downloading the vSphere Replication bundle</h1></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id184" class="indexterm"/>vSphere Replication Server appliance is available for download as an ISO data file or a compressed ZIP package, both of which contain separate OVFs for vSphere Replication Appliance and add-on servers.</p><p>The <strong>vSphere Replication Appliance</strong> (<strong>VRA</strong>) includes a vSphere Replication Management Server and a vSphere Replication Server. It includes a plugin for the vSphere Web Client and also uses a vPostgreSQL embedded database.</p><p>To download the ISO or ZIP bundle, use the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to the vSphere downloads page at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.vmware.com/go/download-vsphere">www.vmware.com/go/download-vsphere</a>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Go to Downloads</strong> hyperlink corresponding to <strong>vSphere Replication 5.5</strong> listed under your license model.</li><li class="listitem">Log in to your <strong>My VMware</strong> account when prompted.</li><li class="listitem">Download either the ZIP or ISO package.</li></ol></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec29"/>Deploying the vSphere Replication Appliance</h1></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id185" class="indexterm"/> vSphere Replication Appliance should be installed at a site where you have virtual machines that need to be protected. It may or may not be required to be installed on both the protected and recovery sites. You will need VRA to be deployed at the recovery site only if you intend to pair it with the protected site. Refer to the following diagram:</p><div><img src="img/6442EN_01_30.jpg" alt="Deploying the vSphere Replication Appliance"/></div><p>The pairing is done by adding the recovery site as a target site to the VRMS at the protected site. Read the <em>Adding a remote site as a target</em> section in <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Configuring and Using vSphere Replication 5.5">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Configuring and Using vSphere Replication 5.5</em>, for information on how to achieve this.</p><p>The<a id="id186" class="indexterm"/> total number of the virtual machines that can be protected by vSphere Replication is 500 per site. The limit is per VRMS, and as there can be only one VRMS registered to a site's vCenter, the 500 VM limit cannot be exceeded. If the VRMSs are paired, then the cumulative limit of VMs from both the sites becomes 500 and not 1000. To deploy the vSphere Replication Appliances, you need the following components:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">vCenter 5.5</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">ESXi hosts compatible with Version 5.5 of vCenter Server</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The downloaded bundle for vSphere Replication 5.5</li></ul></div><p>The appliance's OVF can be deployed using the <strong>Deploy OVF Template</strong> wizard.

All of the initial configuration data and the replication configuration data will be stored in the embedded database. Therefore, it is important that you plan on the type of database before you configure replication for the VMs. This is because if you were to reconfigure the VRMS component to use an external database, then you will lose the existing replication configuration information. You will need to reconfigure the replication on the VMs. Backup and restoration of an external database is easier because you will have to only back up the database files. If you were to plan a backup of the embedded database, then you will have to back up the entire appliance.</p><p>To know which versions of SQL Server are supported, use the <strong>Solution/Database Interoperability</strong> filter on the <strong>VMware Product Interoperability Matrixes</strong> web portal.

You can deploy up to 10 VR Servers appliances per vCenter Server instance. There are several use cases to deploy additional VR Servers. One of the prime reasons is the manual load distribution. Each VR Server with the default memory configuration of 512 MB can handle up to 100 replications. If there are more than 100 VMs being replicated, then you could either choose to increase the memory of the appliance or deploy additional appliances and load balance by distributing the replication traffic to different appliances.</p><p>The following procedure will guide you through the steps required to deploy additional VR Servers:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">From the vSphere Web Client's home page, click on <strong>vSphere Replication</strong> to bring up the vSphere Web Client's interface for vSphere Replication, as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/6442EN_01_22.jpg" alt="Deploying a vSphere Replication Server"/></div></li><li class="listitem">This<a id="id218" class="indexterm"/> page will list the vCenter Server the VRMS is registered to.
