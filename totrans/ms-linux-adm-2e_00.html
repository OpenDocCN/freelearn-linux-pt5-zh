<p><em class="italic">Mastering Linux Administration</em> provides the ultimate coverage of modern server and cloud administration technologies.</p>
<p>Technology evolves at an unprecedented speed, and Linux and related technologies are at the forefront of innovation. This makes it really hard to keep up and learn new things. Present Linux administrators need to know about more than just Linux, thus containerization and cloud technologies are essential for the future DevOps expert.</p>
<p>Linux is the operating system that powers almost everything, from IoT to personal computers to servers, and is the foundation for all cloud technologies. It enables you to master the cloud through the power of the command line.</p>
<p>You will begin by learning about the command line, working with files, processes, users, packages, and filesystems, then you will begin administering network services and hardening security, and finally, you will learn about cloud computing, containers, and orchestration. You will learn how to work at the command line, learn about the most important Linux commands, and master users, processes, and services administration. You will also learn how to harden Linux security using iptables. At the end, you will work with containers, hypervisors, virtual machines, Ansible, and Kubernetes and learn how to deploy Linux on AWS and Azure. By the end of this book, you will have mastered Linux and you will be confident in working with Linux from bare metal to the cloud, in a pure DevOps fashion.</p>
