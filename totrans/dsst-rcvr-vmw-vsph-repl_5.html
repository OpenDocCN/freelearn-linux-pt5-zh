In this chapter, we learn how replication actually works and which configuration tasks are involved with the replication of a virtual machine.</p><p>We will be covering the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adding a remote site as a target</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring the replication of a VM to the local site</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring the replication of a VM to the remote site</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How does replication work?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using the replication seeds</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Monitoring a replication</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Reconfiguring a replication</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Changing the target datastore</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Pausing an ongoing replication</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Synchronizing data immediately</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Stopping a replication for a VM</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Moving a replication to another VR Server</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Recovering virtual machines</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring a Failback for virtual machines</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring SRM to leverage vSphere Replication</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec35"/>Adding a remote site as a target</h1></div></div></div><p>A remote vCenter Server can be added as one of the targets. The <a id="id224" class="indexterm"/>pairing is mandatory when both the sites are managed by different vCenter Servers. This is because the VRM Server registered to the protected site vCenter can only see VR Servers that are registered to it. You can deploy multiple VR Servers at either of the sites, but it can only be used if they are registered to its local VRM Server. The pairing will not be possible if the vCenter Server managing the remote site does not have a VRMS registered to it. Refer to the following diagram:</p><div><img src="img/6442EN_02_31.jpg" alt="Adding a remote site as a target"/></div><p>When adding a target site, you are prompted to specify the address (FQDN/IP) and connection<a id="id225" class="indexterm"/> credentials of the vCenter Server managing the target site. Most environments use separate accounts for connections between different vSphere components. The separate account could also be a service account corresponding to that component. In this case, you could use the service account corresponding to the vCenter Server that you are adding as a target site. Here, the vCenter Server acts as a proxy to communicate with the VRM Server registered to the target site. Once the connection is successfully made, the VRM Server will be listed as the target site.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note10"/>Note</h3><p>The default name of the site of the VRM Server is the name of the vCenter Server it is registered to.

Read the following section for more insight.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec38"/>How does replication work?</h1></div></div></div><p>On<a id="id244" class="indexterm"/> successfully configuring the replication on a VM, it first does an initial full sync of the source VMDKs to the target datastore. If you already have the base VMDKs previously copied to the destination datastore, then only the changed blocks are replicated. The replication happens over the network using the <strong>Network File Copy</strong> (<strong>NFC</strong>)<a id="id245" class="indexterm"/> protocol. The changed blocks are transferred using ESXi's management VMkernel port group.</p><p>Once the initial sync is complete, the VR agent tracks the changed blocks using the vSCSI filter driver. It tracks, writes, and maintains a bitmap of the changed blocks. Every time a replica is created, the data transferred is copied to a redo logfile. This is done to make sure that the VM at the recovery site is not corrupted in the event of a network disruption. The redo log is committed to the base disk only after the changed blocks are fully copied, thereby making each replica crash consistent. When you configure the replication for the VM, you get to choose the RPO and the number of multiple points in time snapshots that you would like to maintain. The RPO ranges from 15 minutes to 24 hours, and you can have up to 24 points in time snapshots. This means you can have up to 24 historical point-time recovery points of the replicated VM.</p><p>Both RPO and the number of points in time instances dictate the number of historical snapshots maintained for the VM. For instance, if you set an RPO of 2 hours, then you will retain 12 point-in-time recovery points for the VM each day. While the RPO is set to 2 hours and if the number of point-in-time instances is set to 4, then you have only 4 snapshots for that VM. VR tries to keep the oldest of the recovery points created.</p><p>Once a replication has been successfully configured, the destination datastore is populated with the following files:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">*.vmdk</code>: This is<a id="id246" class="indexterm"/> the base disk(s) to which the VM data is being replicated to</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">hbrdisk.RDID-*</code>: This<a id="id247" class="indexterm"/> is the redo logfile that has the latest replication data</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">hbrcfg*.vmx</code>: This<a id="id248" class="indexterm"/> is a shadow VMX file that will be used to register the VM when a recovery is initiated</li></ul></div><p>The following screenshot shows the contents of the replica VM's directory:</p><div><img src="img/6442EN_02_13.jpg" alt="How does replication work?"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"/>Note</h3><p>If a <a id="id249" class="indexterm"/>VM being replicated is modified by adding a new VMDK to it, then the active replication will stop with an error. The replication should then be manually reconfigured by the administrator to include the new VMDK and resume the replication.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec39"/>Using the replication seeds</h1></div></div></div><p>When <a id="id250" class="indexterm"/>you configure a replication on a virtual machine for the very first time, the vSphere Replication will need to make an initial copy of the virtual machine's VMDKs. The initial copy can be bandwidth-intensive and time-consuming, based on the size of the VMDKs. We can overcome this by transporting the VMDKs to the intended location, prior to configuring the replication on the VM. The transport method can be of your choice, ideally couriered to the destination site, if remote.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note13"/>Note</h3><p>The copies of the VMDKs transported and placed at the destination datastore are referred to as seeds.</p></div></div><p>The following procedure will guide you through the steps required to use an available seed for a VM:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Shut down the virtual machine at the source (protected) site, which you intend to replicate.</li><li class="listitem">Copy the virtual machine's folder to the target datastore.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec49"/>Configuring SRM to leverage vSphere Replication</h1></div></div></div><p>vSphere<a id="id283" class="indexterm"/> Replication as a standalone product has no ability to automate DR tasks, such as a test, a Failover, or a Failback. SRM can be used to leverage vSphere Replication as the replication engine and use its orchestration ability to automate the DR tasks. Refer to the following diagram:</p><div><img src="img/6442EN_02_32.jpg" alt="Configuring SRM to leverage vSphere Replication"/></div><p>SRM<a id="id284" class="indexterm"/> relies on the concept of two sites that replicates data between them with the help of a replication engine. So, you need two sites managed separately by two different vCenter Servers. Both the vCenter Servers should have a VRMS instance registered to it. Meaning, you need to deploy a <strong>vSphere Replication Appliance</strong> (<strong>VRA</strong>) at both the sites. Once the VRA is deployed, use the vSphere Web Client's vSphere Replication interface at the protected site to add the recovery site as the target site. For more information on how to add target sites, read the <em>Adding a remote site as a target</em> section. Now, for SRM to detect the registered vSphere Replication Appliances at both the sites, you will need to install the vSphere Replication component bundled with the SRM installer. If you already have SRM installed, you can run the installer to repair the installer and install vSphere Replication components as well. Once you have installed the vSphere Replication component, the SRM interface should list vSphere Replication.</p><p>All the DR tasks that can be performed using SRM have been explained in the chapters that cover SRM's array-based replication. Although the DR tasks are notably similar, there are a few changes to the workflow.</p><p>We will cover the following tasks in this section:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating a vSphere Replication Protection Group</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating a vSphere Replication Recovery Plan</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Testing a vSphere Replication Recovery Plan</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Performing <a id="id285" class="indexterm"/>a Failover (Recovery)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Performing a Failback (reprotect and Failover)</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec37"/>Creating a vSphere Replication Protection Group</h2></div></div></div><p>You<a id="id286" class="indexterm"/> will need to create a Protection Group for the virtual machines you would like to protect using vSphere Replication.

A Planned Migration and a Recovery are different in terms of whether the replication of the recent changes is necessary.

A disaster recovery will attempt to replicate the recent changes, but it would continue even if it is unable to do so.</p><p>The procedure is the same regardless of the replication engine in use.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec50"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In the previous chapter, you learned how to set up a vSphere Replication environment, and then use it to configure a replication on virtual machines. We also learned how to stop or pause an ongoing replication and how to move the replication load onto another vSphere Replication Server. More importantly, we learned how to recover a virtual machine from a replica. Most of the replication-related activities that we have discussed in the chapter are done on a per VM basis, and that is all you can do with vSphere Replication when implemented as a standalone solution. We then learned how to configure vCenter Site Recovery Manager to leverage the vSphere Replication and perform the disaster recovery tasks.</p></div></body></html>
