- en: Every VDI architect has his/her own preferred toolset. This toolset may include
    I/O stress test tools such as Iometer or certain Visio stencils. This appendix
    provides a few recommendations for tools that can be used to help in the design
    process. While no design requires the use of these tools, they may prove helpful
    to many.

- en: VMware RAWC (now known as VMware Desktop Planner) is a tool used to stress a
    VMware View environment both in terms of PCoIP traffic as well as generated workload
    on the vDesktops. This tool is available to VMware Partners only and is made available
    through the VMware Partner Central website. However, individual consultants should
    be able to sign themselves up as low-level VMware Partners and receive access
    to the tool. You can get this tool at [http://www.vmware.com/](http://www.vmware.com/).

- en: VDI Fox is an iOS-based application created by the authors of this book. VDI
    Fox uses the logic found in the [myvirtualcloud.net](http://myvirtualcloud.net)
    VDI calculators that have become the industry standard, and made them available
    in the palm of a VDI engineer’s hand. In addition, VDI Fox steers its user through
    a VDI design with a questionnaire to help VDI engineers of all levels navigate
    their way through VDI.
