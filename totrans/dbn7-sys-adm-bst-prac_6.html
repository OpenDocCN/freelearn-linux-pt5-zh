Debian provides some assistance here, with special packages that help in hardening your systems, but this is only the beginning. In particular, you must pay attention to how you set up the root account, how to block improper access to your systems, and how to monitor your system for security problems.</p><div class="section" title="User administration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec35"/>User administration</h1></div></div></div><p>One of the first things to consider is how to set up user groups and how to manage the root account. Although this can be changed any time, it should be done just after installation when changes <a id="id257" class="indexterm"/>will have less impact. The two basic issues are how to set up default user group assignment, and whether the root account should be disabled.</p><div class="section" title="Default user group"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec83"/>Default user group</h2></div></div></div><p>Traditionally, there are two ways to set up the default group assigned to a new user. The first is to have everyone assigned<a id="id258" class="indexterm"/> to a single users group. This will allow all users on the system access files and directories with group read (and execute) permissions, and write to files with group write permissions.</p><p>The other way is to give each user his own groups, usually with the same name as his user ID. This is the default in Debian, and this scheme is often referred to as user private groups. If user A wants others to be able to access certain files or directories via the group permissions, someone with system privileges that allow group modification must add the appropriate user IDs to user A's group.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note39"/>Note</h3><p>At one point, a single users group was common practice. Best practice at present, though, is to use user private groups.</p></div></div><p>This is similar to the most common way to handle developer's access to each other's files. In this case, though, a new group, such as <code class="literal">web-dev</code> or whatever you feel is an appropriate group name, is created and the developers are assigned to it as necessary. A similar technique is used for some administration tasks as well. For example, an <code class="literal">ftpadmin</code> group that is allowed to<a id="id259" class="indexterm"/> modify the FTP server directories and files in ways that the normal (and especially the anonymous) ftp user cannot. Careful creation and assignment of groups can facilitate proper user access to files while preventing undesired access or modification.</p><p>User and group maintenance is handled by the standard command-line functions<a id="id260" class="indexterm"/>, such as <code class="literal">useradd</code>, <code class="literal">usermod</code>, <code class="literal">userdel</code>, <code class="literal">groupadd</code>, <code class="literal">groupmod</code>, and <code class="literal">groupdel</code>, all documented in the <code class="literal">passwd</code> package. Of course, there are GUI utilities available for user and group maintenance as well.</p></div><div class="section" title="ACLs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec84"/>ACLs</h2></div></div></div><p>While the traditional <a id="id261" class="indexterm"/>user/group/world permissions structure is adequate for many systems, there are times when more fine-grained control is required. This may be handled by using <span class="strong"><strong>Access Control Lists </strong></span>(<span class="strong"><strong>ACL</strong></span>). ACLs are implemented using the extended attributes available in various filesystems and are available by default in the EXT filesystems normally used in Debian Linux. The<a id="id262" class="indexterm"/> details may be found in the Debian <code class="literal">acl</code> package. In particular, check out the manual pages for the <code class="literal">getacl</code>, <code class="literal">setacl</code>, and <code class="literal">chacl</code> commands.</p><p>While ACLs are useful, there are some issues to be aware of. For example, most graphical file managers do not support them, and some utilities (EMACS comes to mind) clear the file ACL list when updating a file. This can be addressed somewhat by setting a default ACL for the directory, but non-default file ACLs will still need to be reconstructed if they are lost. Another issue is performance. On some filesystems, the existence of an ACL delays the initial file access due to the additional access verification required. Since this occurs only on the initial access, its impact is often minimal in practice. Finally, there is the issue of backups when you use ACLs. Most backup utilities now recognize ACLs. In Debian Linux, both <code class="literal">rsync</code> and <code class="literal">tar</code> now have options to allow them to recognize and back up ACLs, but they are only handled if you use the proper command options. The EXT backup utilities dump and restore also handle ACLs. However, some utilities may not recognize or handle ACLs properly, so always check the package documentation and manual pages if you use Access Control Lists.</p><p>Note that, if you do use ACLs, you are not required to use them for all files and directories. It is quite possible to set them on only those files and directories that need them. Judicious use of file ACLs and default ACLs set for certain directories will help streamline ACL management.</p></div><div class="section" title="The root account"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec85"/>The root account</h2></div></div></div><p>Root access to a system is a serious issue. Anyone who knows the root password can do great damage, and the more people who know it, the greater the chance of the password getting into the wrong hands. To avoid this problem, the <code class="literal">sudo</code> package provides the ability to run commands as if one were the<a id="id263" class="indexterm"/> root user (including, if desired, a shell with full root permissions) without requiring the root password, only the user's own password and proper authorization. The advantage of this is that authorized commands are logged with the user's ID, providing an audit of who actually performed the command.</p><p>When <code class="literal">sudo</code> is used on a system, the only remaining use for the administrator password is when the system is booted into maintenance (single user) mode. Most Linux distributions, including Debian, require the root password before providing the root shell prompt in single user mode. However, this requirement can be bypassed in several ways by someone with access to the physical console. Therefore, many administrators completely disable the root password. When this is done, booting into maintenance or single user mode no longer prompts for the root password.</p><p>By disabling the root password completely, root-level access to the system via any method other than <code class="literal">sudo</code>, other programs that provide root privileges to normal users (also known as <span class="strong"><strong>setuid</strong></span> programs), or via boot into single user mode is not possible. Note that, since booting into maintenance mode no longer requires a password, physical access to the system console must be controlled in some other way. This may be done by physical means, by requiring a password for the system boot via <span class="strong"><strong>BIOS</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Basic Input/Output System</strong></span>) or <span class="strong"><strong>UEFI</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</strong></span>), or by password protecting the GRUB or other system boot loader.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note40"/>Note</h3><p>Best practice is to disable the root account login completely. <a id="id264" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ubuntu</strong></span> now does this by default, and Debian is moving in that direction. Make sure you either restrict physical access to the console or password protect the boot process.</p></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">/etc/sudoers</code> file and files in the <code class="literal">/etc/sudoers.d</code> directory are where <code class="literal">sudo</code> access is configured. The details are provided in the <code class="literal">sudo</code> package documentation. Briefly, access to commands can be allowed or restricted by individual user, group members, or even lists and can allow access to commands depending on the remote host from which the user is accessing the system.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Debian hardening packages"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec36"/>Debian hardening packages</h1></div></div></div><p>Debian provides several packages to assist the administrator in securing the system. They are all meta packages, and include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">harden</code>: This installs <a id="id265" class="indexterm"/>harden-environment and harden-servers</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">harden-clients</code>: This prevents<a id="id266" class="indexterm"/> installation of software clients that have the potential to expose critical information or allow unauthorized access to your system</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">harden-environment</code>: This installs <a id="id267" class="indexterm"/>tools for intrusion detection</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">harden-nids</code>: This installs tools for<a id="id268" class="indexterm"/> network intrusion detection</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">harden-servers</code>: This prevents<a id="id269" class="indexterm"/> installation of services that are potentially insecure and could allow unauthorized access to your system</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">harden-tools</code>: This installs tools <a id="id270" class="indexterm"/>to help enhance and analyze system security</li></ul></div><p>There are other hardening packages that install tools to analyze or audit systems remotely, and help developers create more secure programs. The packages can be found by searching the package cache for "harden". One way to do this is the command <code class="literal">apt-cache search harden</code>.</p><p>Installing any of these packages is just a start, and won't automatically make your system secure. They are just a way of installing groups of security related packages, or preventing certain packages from being installed if they have potential security issues. In particular, if you install <code class="literal">harden-environment</code>, <code class="literal">harden-nids</code>, and <code class="literal">harden-tools</code>, you will also need to consult the appropriate package documentation and configure them properly to detect and analyze security issues, issue the proper warnings, or take the necessary actions.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note41"/>Note</h3><p>One thing to be aware of is that some of these packages prevent the installation of certain services, such as an FTP server. If your server must provide FTP services (for example), then first install the appropriate hardening packages. After the install completes, install the FTP package confirming that you want to remove the hardening package. That way, you at least know that insecure services other than FTP have not been installed. To maintain that assurance, periodically test what <code class="literal">harden-servers</code> would remove if installed. This can be done, for example, by running <code class="literal">apt-get –dry-run install harden-servers</code>, and examining the output to see what would be done. </p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Firewall tools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec37"/>Firewall tools</h1></div></div></div><p>One thing that the hardening packages do not provide is tools for protecting your systems via firewalls. This absence belies their importance in securing your systems, as a short search of Debian packages will show many tools for building firewalls. They vary from simple to complex, and from command line to full graphic interface. Nearly all are frontends for <span class="strong"><strong>IPTABLES</strong></span>,<a id="id271" class="indexterm"/> the Linux kernel firewall modules and associated commands, and produce appropriate configuration files. Some provide a simple configuration language that is more readable than the standard <code class="literal">iptables</code> commands, which the tool then translates into the proper commands for you. Some provide a way of defining firewall policies, which are then translated into proper <code class="literal">iptables</code> configuration commands.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip28"/>Tip</h3><p>Even if your system is already behind a firewall, it is good practice to provide its own firewall as well. This multilayer approach provides additional protection in case the first firewall is somehow compromised.</p></div></div><p>Of course, with the variety of firewall packages available, it is difficult to recommend any particular package over the others. Each has strengths and weaknesses. However, if we restrict ourselves to the more popular packages, there are a few general recommendations that can be made.</p><p>First, for desktop and development systems which don't require extremely complex configurations, <a id="id272" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>firestarter</strong></span> (for GNOME) or <a id="id273" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>guarddog</strong></span> (KDE) are good starting points. They are oriented towards beginners but have advanced options that can be useful to more experienced users. Both are graphical applications. A special case is<a id="id274" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>fireflier</strong></span>, which actually analyzes the applications traffic on the system and recommends rules. Mason is a similar application, but it does not offer a graphical interface.</p><p>For servers or systems that require more robust protection, consider <span class="strong"><strong>fwbuilder</strong></span>. It is similar to many enterprise firewall management systems and can provide configuration not only for Linux (both IPTABLES and IPCHAINS rules), but also BSD, Mac OS/X, and Cisco access-lists as well. Configurations for multiple servers can be kept in one place and installed remotely as needed. Refer to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/">http://www.fwbuilder.org/</a> for more information.</p><p>A popular alternative is <a id="id275" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Shorewall</strong></span>, which can also handle traffic shaping and IPsec to some extent. Shorewall uses text configuration files rather than a graphic interface. More information may be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://shorewall.net/">http://shorewall.net/</a>.</p><p>In all cases, for Debian Linux, the firewall packages control traffic by generating the IPTABLES rules used by the kernel modules to recognize, analyze, and control network traffic.</p><div class="section" title="IPTABLES"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec86"/>IPTABLES</h2></div></div></div><p>IPTABLES, which supersedes the old IPCHAINS code, is the generic name for what is actually a group of kernel modules and applications used to define and control Linux kernel firewalling. It actually includes modules and applications to provide IPv4, IPv6, ARP, and Ethernet Frame packet filtering as well as some stateful inspection of packets. There are many options for<a id="id276" class="indexterm"/> filtering, depending not only on the packet characteristics (such as protocol, source and destination addresses), but on how the packet is being handled, such as whether it is just entering the system, being forwarded, exiting to the network, needs address translation (such as <span class="strong"><strong>Network Address Translation</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>NAT</strong></span>),<a id="id277" class="indexterm"/> related to an established connection. There are several good books available on IPTABLES, or you can start with the documentation on the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.netfilter.org">www.netfilter.org</a> website, which is the home of IPTABLES code as well as many related projects.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note42"/>Note</h3><p>There is a project,<a id="id278" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>NFTABLES</strong></span>, which is slated to replace IPTABLES in the kernel. It is still under development and at the time of writing, there is no official Debian support (either in Debian 7 or the testing release for Debian 8). However, there are compatibility packages in the works, and once the code becomes part of the official Linux kernel, official Debian packages are expected to follow.</p></div></div><p>Since most firewall packages provide their own ways to define your firewalls and output the appropriate iptables configuration commands, it is not necessary to understand all of the gritty details of IPTABLES, but a good administrator will want to understand the basics for a couple of reasons. First, it will help in understanding the capabilities of the firewall configuration software, since the features will be based on what can be done with IPTABLES, and second, it will be needed if you use something such as fireflier or mason, which propose rules and expect you to modify or delete them as required for your specific environment.</p><p>Of course, beyond understanding what is possible, it is necessary to figure out what is required for your firewall.</p></div><div class="section" title="Basic firewall design"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec87"/>Basic firewall design</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many books <a id="id279" class="indexterm"/>and reams of Internet advice on building firewalls. The classic work on the subject is <span class="emphasis"><em>Building Internet Firewalls</em></span> by <span class="emphasis"><em>Elizabeth D. Zwicky</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Simon Cooper</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>D. Brent Chapman</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>O'Reilly Media</em></span>. However, for our present purposes, we'll cover some basic design principles.</p><div class="section" title="Inbound opens"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec19"/>Inbound opens</h3></div></div></div><p>Any time someone can open a connection to a system, that system can be attacked via that connection. This doesn't refer to inbound traffic in general, especially since much of this will be related to connections the local system established. It refers to the request from a remote system for a new connection to a local service. This is usually called an inbound open as it involves<a id="id280" class="indexterm"/> an initial request by a remote system to open a connection on a specific IP port.</p><p>Of course, if your system is a server that provides services to remote users, you must allow requests for services your server provides. Just don't allow any other inbound requests, and if you can, limit the source address of the requests unless the service is to be provided to anyone and everyone.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip29"/>Tip</h3><p>Limit inbound requests (opens) to only those absolutely required to provide particular services to remote clients. Do not allow any other inbound traffic unless it is on or related to an established connection.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Outbound traffic"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec20"/>Outbound traffic</h3></div></div></div><p>In general, outbound traffic is legitimate, and many administrators do not restrict traffic originating on the local system<a id="id281" class="indexterm"/> going to remote systems. Unfortunately, there are cases where this is not advisable. A common example is when a company wishes to restrict the outside services its employees can use (such as preventing the use of YouTube because it is inappropriate for them to be using it during working hours). Another example, though, is the case where a system has been compromised and starts contacting a remote command and control system for orders and additional malicious software to install.</p><p>Both cases may be handled by at least logging, and in many cases restricting outbound traffic. In most cases it is sufficient to limit outbound opens (requests for a new connection).</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip30"/>Tip</h3><p>On a personal system, outbound opens need not be restricted unless company policy requires such restrictions. On a server, outbound opens should be restricted to those services that the server requires for proper operation. Outbound traffic should be allowed only if it is on or related to an established connection.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Local loopback traffic"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec21"/>Local loopback traffic</h3></div></div></div><p>Most administrators are not concerned with <a id="id282" class="indexterm"/>traffic on the local loopback interface. This is because such traffic is often necessary for proper operation of the local system. It is also rather difficult to analyze in order<a id="id283" class="indexterm"/> to determine what is necessary and what may be safely blocked without affecting normal operation. The major reason to firewall loopback traffic is that if rogue software is installed on the system by a virus or worm, then that software has more avenues to further attack the local system over the unprotected loopback interface. It may allow a minor compromise to exploit the opening to become a major system takeover.</p><p>The major trade-off here is whether the likelihood of compromise and the resulting potential for damage justify the additional time and effort required to analyze and create a proper firewall for the loopback interface.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip31"/>Tip</h3><p>If a system is subject to frequent, serious attacks, consider firewalling the local loopback interface as well.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="The perimeter network"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec22"/>The perimeter network</h3></div></div></div><p>Probably <a id="id284" class="indexterm"/>one of the most <a id="id285" class="indexterm"/>important ways to protect private networks while still providing services available to the public Internet is by using a perimeter network. Often called a <a id="id286" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>De-Militarized Zone</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>DMZ</strong></span>), it is a buffer between attackers and your internal network.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3118OS_06_01.jpg" alt="The perimeter network"/></div><p>In the previous diagram, there are two architectures given. The traditional design uses two firewalls with<a id="id287" class="indexterm"/> the perimeter network placed in between them. The reason for this is that if the external firewall which is exposed directly to the Internet and attack is compromised, the attacker still has to get through the internal firewall before he has access to systems on your internal network. Experience has shown that firewall compromise is uncommon enough that a single firewall can be used reasonably safely, as shown on the right. The dual firewall architecture is still preferred for high security environments.</p><p>In all cases,<a id="id288" class="indexterm"/> the only systems that can be accessed from the Internet are those on the perimeter network. Those servers must not have any access to internal servers through the firewall. Internal servers can connect to the perimeter systems and thus allow two-way communication, but servers on the perimeter should never be able to initiate connections to internal systems. This prevents a compromised server from further endangering your internal network.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip32"/>Tip</h3><p>No matter how careful you are, any server connected to the Internet will be attacked, and attacked frequently. Sooner or later, one of those attacks will succeed. No server that allows any outside access is completely immune to compromise. Best practice for any system, not just Debian, is to place Internet servers on a perimeter network in order to protect your internal systems and data in the event<a id="id289" class="indexterm"/> an Internet server is compromised.</p></div></div><p>So, now you have<a id="id290" class="indexterm"/> your system properly firewalled. As mentioned previously, you will still be attacked, and eventually compromised. The next section deals with how to detect both the attempts and any compromise as soon as possible.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Intrusion detection"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec38"/>Intrusion detection</h1></div></div></div><p>Debian includes a <a id="id291" class="indexterm"/>number of intrusion detection applications. There are three basic classes: <span class="strong"><strong>Network Intrusion Detection Systems</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>NIDS</strong></span>),<a id="id292" class="indexterm"/> File Monitors, and System Scanners. The former works by scanning network traffic to detect attempts to discover and exploit allowed network connections. The latter works by scanning a known clean system, then monitoring it for new, deleted, and modified files.</p><div class="section" title="NIDS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec88"/>NIDS</h2></div></div></div><p>Network Intrusion Detection basically involves monitoring network interfaces, analyzing all the packets seen, and providing alerts when certain attack characteristics are seen. On Debian, the primary<a id="id293" class="indexterm"/> tool for this is <a id="id294" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Snort</strong></span>. <a id="id295" class="indexterm"/>Snort will be installed if you install <code class="literal">harden-nids</code>, mentioned <a id="id296" class="indexterm"/>previously. Other packages are also available in Debian as well.</p><p>Snort can be paired with a package called<a id="id297" class="indexterm"/> <code class="literal">fwsnort</code> to not only detect potential attacks, but block them dynamically via adding IPTABLES rules when attacks are detected.</p><p>One caveat is that NIDS can only analyze traffic they actually see. They will see all traffic on whatever interfaces they monitor (in fact, Snort will see it before IPTABLES does, ensuring that all traffic is analyzed). However, if your system is protected by an external firewall (for example, if it's on a perimeter network), it will only see packets that are allowed through the external firewall. Because of this, NIDS may be of limited use unless it is run on the external firewall. Nevertheless, it is still useful to detect attack attempts that manage to get through the external firewall.</p></div><div class="section" title="File Monitors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec89"/>File Monitors</h2></div></div></div><p>The second level of intrusion detection involves monitoring the files on the system. There are several good monitors<a id="id298" class="indexterm"/> that will alert you to new, deleted, or modified files, usually filtering the reports so they include only changes that indicate a potential compromise. The most commonly used File Monitor is <a id="id299" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tripwire</strong></span> and that is what is installed by the <code class="literal">harden-environment</code> package. However, Tripwire is now owned by a commercial enterprise that sells proprietary versions. While open source tripwire is still available, many administrators are switching to <span class="strong"><strong>AIDE</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment</strong></span>)<a id="id300" class="indexterm"/> or <span class="strong"><strong>Samhain</strong></span> as alternatives.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip33"/>Tip</h3><p>Configure your file monitors carefully to catch important changes and filter out as many false positives as possible without filtering out the true positives.</p></div></div><p>The importance of filtering your results can't be overemphasized. An alert or report with too many false positives will frequently be skimmed at best or ignored at worst, and can result in missing a true positive indication of compromised files.</p></div><div class="section" title="System scanners"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec90"/>System scanners</h2></div></div></div><p>System scanners include packages that scan for possible rootkits that may be installed or active on your system, and <a id="id301" class="indexterm"/>virus scanners. The packages <code class="literal">rkhunter</code> and <code class="literal">chkrootkit</code> are two of the most used rootkit detection packages. <a id="id302" class="indexterm"/>The <code class="literal">Tiger</code> package is a somewhat more comprehensive scanner that uses <code class="literal">chkrootkit</code> and Tripwire or AIDE as well as its own scripts to perform a full audit of your system's security. After the first audit of your clean system, <code class="literal">Tiger</code> will alert you to changes in your system's vulnerabilities.</p><p>The only major function absent from <code class="literal">Tiger</code> is virus scanning, which can be handled by the <code class="literal">clamav</code> package, which also provides live scanning of email.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip34"/>Tip</h3><p>Best practice is to set up regular system security audits.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="A final word on remote logging"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec39"/>A final word on remote logging</h1></div></div></div><p>One of the first things an <a id="id303" class="indexterm"/>accomplished hacker will do once he penetrates a system is attempt to erase all signs of system compromise. This includes removing entries from log files, hiding files, and network connections so they can't be shown using normal utilities, and so on. They may even go so far as to install their own compromised versions of your intrusion detection software, and your file and system scanners that won't report any sign of their illicit activities. One of the best countermeasures for this is to set your system up to write your system logs and NIDS and scan results to a remote system. Many scanners also provide ways to encrypt and verify configuration files <a id="id304" class="indexterm"/>and scan databases to protect them from compromise as well.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip35"/>Tip</h3><p>If your system is subject to frequent attacks, set up remote logging, reporting, and alerting, and secure the configuration files and databases of your system and file scanners and your Intrusion Detection System.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec40"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>System security is one of the most important duties of an administrator.
