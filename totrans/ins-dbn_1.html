They are not the vehicle but the center of gravity of a big part of the IT industry, including the enterprise customers.</p><p>No longer do companies choose a technology stack just because of features but because of reduced time to market, which enables them to grow faster and accommodate demand while keeping a sane bottom line.</p><p>Debian has a long-standing tradition as a very flexible GNU/Linux-based distribution, in part because of its packaging system and also because it has been made possible by a dynamic community of developers and maintainers.</p><p>Even though it is a proven platform for web applications, most web developers face steep learning curves. Maybe this happens because they are not familiar with GNU/Linux, they have an enterprise experience with other packaging systems such as RPM, or because they traditionally didn't manage aspects such as performance or security.</p><p>Although it's meant to be just a starting point in your Debian journey, the standardized instructions in this book, such as using <code class="literal">sudo</code> or <code class="literal">apt-get</code>, can be replicated across most administrative and development scenarios you will encounter in the future.</p><p>The book also outlines an effective approach to performance and scaling by presenting different architectures that can help accommodate growth, including cloud computing, where Debian can run as a workload to increase your efficiencies.</p><p>This micro book covers the decision-making process, installation, and configuration of a solid foundation on which you can deploy web-based applications on Debian—whether they are written on PHP, Perl, Python, or Ruby.</p><p>Starting off by providing a little knowledge of Debian, this book will guide you to a properly configured system that tackles the most common pitfalls DevOps encounter, such as partitioning, filesystem permissions, or scaling, thereby providing a straightforward approach to Debian for web applications.</p><p>Without further ado, we can proceed to the first set of recipes.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Choosing the right flavor of Debian (Simple)</h1></div></div></div><p>The Debian Project prides itself on producing the Universal Operating System. This means that the software the project puts together runs on a broad set of hardware (architectures) for several types of purposes, and even for different kernels such as Linux, Hurd, or FreeBSD.</p><p>Choosing the right flavor of Debian for your setup might seem intimidating at first, but this recipe will provide you with decision elements to help you reduce your time to market with Debian and choose the right architecture and installation method, particularly for a web server.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>At any point in time, Debian has three different branches available for use: stable, testing, and unstable. Think of unstable as the cutting edge of free software; it has reasonably modern software packages, and sometimes those packages introduce changes or features that may break the user experience. After an amount of time has passed (usually 10 days, but it depends on the package's upload priority), the new software is considered to be relatively safe to use and is moved to testing. Testing can provide a good balance between modern software and relatively reliable software. Testing goes through several iterations during the course of several years, and eventually it's frozen for a new stable release. This stable release is supported by the Debian Project for a number of years, including feature and security updates.</p><p>Chances are you are building something that has an interesting team of people to back it up. In such scenarios, web development teams have chosen to go with testing, or even unstable, in order to get the latest software available. In other cases, conservative teams or groups with less savvy staff have resorted to stable because it's consistent for years.</p><p>It is up to you to choose between any, but this book will get you started with stable. You can change your <strong>Advanced Packaging Tool</strong> (<strong>APT</strong>) configuration later and upgrade to testing and unstable, but the initial installation media that we will use will be stable. Also, it is important that developers target the production environment as closely as possible. If you use stable for production, using stable for development will save a lot of time debugging mismatches.</p><p>You should know which versions of programming languages, modules, libraries, frameworks, and databases your application will be targeting, as this will influence the selection of your branch. You can go to <a class="ulink" href="http://packages.debian.org">packages.debian.org</a> to check the versions available for a specific package across different branches. Choosing testing (outside a freeze period) and unstable will also mean that you'll need to have an upgrade strategy where you continuously check for new updates (with tools such as cron-apt) and install them if you want to take advantage of new bug fixes and so on.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>How to do it…</h2></div></div></div><p>Debian offers a plethora of installation methods for the operating system. From standard CDs and DVDs, Debian also offers reduced-size installation media, bootable USB images, network boot, and other methods. The complexity of installation is a relative factor that usually is of no concern for DevOps since installation only happens once, while configuration and administration are continuously happening.</p><p>Before you start considering replication methods (such as precooked images, network distribution, configuration management, and software delivery), you and your team can choose from the following installation methods:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you are installing Debian on a third-party provider (such as a cloud vendor), they will either provide a Debian image for you, or you can prepare your own in virtualization software and upload the disk later.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you are installing on your own hardware (including virtualized environments), it's advisable to get either the netinst ISO or the full first DVD ISO. It all depends on whether you are installing several servers over the course of several months (thus making the DVD obsolete as new updates come out) or have a good Internet connection (or proxies and caching facilities, nearby CDNs, and so on) for downloading any additional packages that the netinst disk might not contain.</li></ul></div><p>In general, if you are only deploying a handful of servers and have a good Internet connection at hand, I'd suggest you choose the amd64 netinst ISO, which we will use in this book.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>There's more…</h2></div></div></div><p>There are several other points that you need to consider while choosing the right flavor of Debian. One of them is the architecture you're using and targeting for development.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>Architectures</h3></div></div></div><p>There are tens of computer architectures available in the market. ARM, Intel, AMD, SPARC, and Alpha are all different types of architectures.</p><p>Debian uses the architecture codenames i386 and amd64 for historical reasons. i386 actually means an Intel or Intel-compatible, 32-bit processor (x86), while amd64 means an Intel or Intel-compatible, 64-bit processor (x86_64). The brand of the processor is irrelevant.</p><p>A few years ago, choosing between the two was tricky as some binary-only, non-free libraries and software were not always available for 64-bit processors, and architecture mismatches happened. While there were workarounds (such as running a 32-bit-only software using special libraries), it was basically a matter of time until popular software such as Flash caught up with 64-bit versions—thus, the concern was mainly about laptops and desktops.</p><p>Nowadays, if your CPU (and/or your hypervisor) has 64-bit capabilities (most Intel do), it's considered a good practice to use the amd64 architecture. We will use amd64 in this book. And since Debian 7.0, the multiarch feature has been included, allowing more than one architecture to be installed and be active on the same hardware.</p><p>While the market seems to settle around 64-bit Intel processors, the choice of an architecture is still important because it determines the future availability of software that you can choose from Debian. There might be some software that is not compiled for or not compatible with your specific architecture, but there is software that is independent of the architecture.</p><p>DevOps are usually pragmatic when it comes to choosing architectures, so the following two questions aim to help you understand what to expect when it comes to it:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Will you run your web applications on your own hardware? If so, do you already have this hardware or will you procure it?<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you need to procure hardware, take a look at the existing server hardware in your datacenter. Factors such as a preferred vendor, hardware standardization, and so on are all important when choosing the right architecture. From the most popular 32- or 64-bit Intel and AMD processors, the growing ARM ecosystem, and also the more venerable but declining SPARC or Itanium, Debian is available for lots of architectures.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you are out in the market for new hardware, your options are most likely based on an Intel- or AMD-compatible, 32- or 64-bit, server-grade processor. Your decisions will be influenced by factors such as the I/O capacity (throughput and speed), memory, disk, and so on, and the architecture will most likely be covered by Debian.</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">Will you run your web applications on third-party hardware, such as a <strong>Virtual Private Server</strong> (<strong>VPS</strong>) provider or a cloud <strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<strong>IaaS</strong>) provider?<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Most providers will provide you with prebuilt images for Debian. They are either 32- or 64-bit, x86 images that have some sort of community support—but, be aware they might have no vendor support, or in some cases waive warranties and/or other factors such as the SLA.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You should be able to prepare your own Debian installation using virtualization software (such as KVM, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V) and then upload the virtual disk (VHD, VDI, and so on) to your provider.</li></ul></div></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>Installing Debian GNU/Linux (Simple)</h1></div></div></div><p>Once you choose the right installation method for Debian, you're ready to fire up the Debian-Installer. During installation you will also execute the initial configuration, and you will need to decide on several important factors of your setup, such as partitioning.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>Before you start to install Debian, you will need to decide how you want to partition your disks. There are several reasons why one would like to partition disks beyond the <strong>canonical</strong> one-partition approach, most likely for security or specialized storage reasons. Also, if you will be using SAN/NAS dedicated hardware, the setup can be either simplified or made more complex.</p><p>Debian, like several POSIX-compliant operating systems and some other Linux distributions, follows the FHS or Filesystem Hierarchy Standard and you can expect configuration files in <code class="literal">/etc</code>, system files in <code class="literal">/usr</code> and <code class="literal">/lib</code>, variable files in <code class="literal">/var</code>, and so on.</p><p>There might be some discrepancies, though. FHS calls for <code class="literal">/srv</code> for server roles, but most installations sit variable files in <code class="literal">/var</code>. Static files, application files, and even database files all sit there. Thus, you might want to put <code class="literal">/var</code> on a different partition if you have advanced partitioning or permission needs. You could even partition out <code class="literal">/var/lib/mysql</code> for the MySQL database files, <code class="literal">/var/www</code> for the static and application files (the <code class="literal">WWW/Document Root</code> folder), and so on, like we will do as an example in this book using <strong>Logical Volumes</strong> (<strong>LVM</strong>).</p><p>Logical volumes will enable you to create more flexible data containers on top of concepts you already know: disks and partitions. Those flexible data containers created by logical volumes can expand different partitions in different disks and are easier to manage, resize, and move. But it can also add management overhead, and will require a more complex set up for clustering.</p><p>By <strong>granular</strong> we mean the ability of setting different behaviors on different partitions depending on the use case. For example, a system administrator can partition out <code class="literal">/var/mail</code> to set ACLs/quotas and so on, DevOps might want to partition out <code class="literal">/var</code> to set security flags such as <code class="literal">noexec</code> (no executable files, which is OK in your web application since processes outside <code class="literal">/var</code> actually run your application), <code class="literal">nodev</code> (no special device files), and <code class="literal">nosuid</code> (no auto-escalation files) or remove filesystem attributes that impact performance (such as time), among others.</p><p>Here's a list of flags and their impact on partitioning:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom">

</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Other directories that you might want to partition out are <code class="literal">/tmp</code>, which will inevitably store temporary files generated by your framework, your application server and other services, making the <code class="literal">noexec/nodev/nosuid</code> combo is very popular in this case to prevent the execution of potentially malicious files, along with dedicated disk space monitoring to prevent the partition from filling out, which can stop the server altogether.</p><p>In other scenarios (such as the mail server we talked about earlier), people will find great value in partitioning out <code class="literal">/home</code>, as they will be able to set ACLs and quotas and manage space much easier. But in a web application server scenario, while you are free to continue partitioning (Debian will partition out the swap space and <code class="literal">/boot</code> for you), the benefit you can get from continuing to do so (<code class="literal">/usr</code>, <code class="literal">/etc</code>, and so on) is arguable and can add unnecessary complexity.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>How to do it…</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you've decided on whether you want to partition out things or not, how you will split disk space, which flags/policies you will set to each partition and whether you'll use RAID, LVM, and any other technique (SAN/NAS, and so on), you can follow these steps to install Debian:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst">www.debian.org/distrib/netinst</a>, and choose <strong>amd64</strong> under <strong>Small CDs</strong>. The ISO file will download. You can now burn the ISO to a CD/DVD (if you need a physical disk to install), or boot your hypervisor with this ISO file. Since Debian 7.0, ISO files can also be written to USB media, and you can find specific images for previous releases under the <code class="literal">hd-media</code> folders. There are installation instructions on the installation manual available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual">http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual</a>; alternatively, you can create a bootable USB from the netinst ISO using UNetbootin.</li><li class="listitem">Fire up your server, and put the netinst disk in your CD/DVD unit. Reboot your server and follow the onscreen instructions (or manual instructions) to boot from CD/DVD. Debian will greet you with the following screen:<div><img alt="How to do it…" src="img/8840OS_02_01.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Hitting <em>ENTER</em> will suffice. The Debian installation will start, and you will be guided through a series of prompts (leveraging a technology called debconf) that will help you install and perform the initial setup of your installation. You might choose <strong>Graphical install</strong>, which will run you through the same prompts but with mouse support, colors, buttons, and scrollbars. In both modes, you can use keyboard shortcuts to make things easier (for example, in the following screen, pressing <em>S</em> to go for <strong>Spanish</strong> from a list of languages, using <em>Home</em>/<em>End</em>/<em>Page Up</em>/<em>Page Dn</em>, and so on).<div><img alt="How to do it…" src="img/8840OS_02_02.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Choose the installation language. You can just hit <em>Enter</em> if you want <strong>English</strong>. Debian prides itself on having an installer available in several languages. Your selection will also hint the installer on the default country, mirrors, and time zones. Depending on your location you may want to adjust the following screens. Pay special attention to time zones, as time keeping and proper hostnames are essential to a properly functioning Linux server. Your selection will also define the keyboard layout. For example, non-English speaking people using the Latin alphabet might choose <strong>US – International</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Now, Debian will check for network connectivity. Particularly, it tries to get an IPv4 address from a DHCP server. This might not be your scenario, as DHCP servers are not usually deployed on web application environments. The operation will time out, and you will be asked to configure your network interface: IP address for the server, network mask, gateway, and DNS servers. The screen will be similar to the following screenshot:<div><img alt="How to do it…" src="img/8840OS_02_03.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">The next step is the hostname/domain prompt. As mentioned before, this is an important part, as you want to construct a <strong>Fully Qualified Domain Name</strong> (<strong>FQDN</strong>) that looks like <code class="literal">foo.bar.com</code>, where <code class="literal">foo</code> is your hostname and <code class="literal">bar.com</code> is your domain name. You don't need to <strong>own</strong> bar.com—and if you do, the IP addresses don't need to match or even exist in your DNS zone. Although it is highly recommended to use a real FQDN—both for troubleshooting and for performance reasons. You need to have the FQDN as you will use it later for network troubleshooting, clustering, copying files, and so on; if it is not configured correctly, it can be the source of lots of headaches. Large server setups use nomenclature to pinpoint the server they are managing later (such as, www-mia-01 or db-pdx-05). The input screen for the hostname is shown as follows:<div><img alt="How to do it…" src="img/8840OS_02_04.jpg"/></div><p>And similarly, for FQDN, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img alt="How to do it…" src="img/8840OS_02_05.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Next, define the root (administrator or superuser) password. You should pick a complex one, even if it's hard to remember, since you will not be using it on a day-to-day basis and will most likely be using <code class="literal">sudo</code> instead—a delegation mechanism. And you will also define an initial user with no special permissions (but basic device access)—go ahead and put in generic information if you like but still protect the account with a strong password as this user will be able to login via <strong>Secure Shell</strong> (<strong>SSH</strong>) and execute commands on a shell, which in a web application scenario are all potential points of entry. We will use DevOps.</li><li class="listitem">It's time for partitioning. With the information gathered at the preparation stage, you will now define partitions either manually (most likely) or by using the guided mode. In the guided mode, it will be easier for you to set up, say LVM, but you will wind up with only three choices: all in one partition, separate <code class="literal">/home</code>, or separate <code class="literal">/home</code>, <code class="literal">/usr</code>, <code class="literal">/var</code>, and <code class="literal">/tmp</code>—and as mentioned before, you might not want to split <code class="literal">/home</code> and <code class="literal">/usr</code>. You can always delete those partitions and give space back to <code class="literal">/var</code> and <code class="literal">/tmp</code> (<code class="literal">/tmp</code> could be a couple of GB unless you have a hungry app in which case you should watch tmpfs memory usage). Also, you can always change the partitions (and even partition from scratch with resizing and everything) when the system is already operating, ideally before you start throwing data into it.</li><li class="listitem">Our suggestion is that you choose LVM and all in one partition, and then delete the logical volume for root and start splitting that space in new logical volumes. In our example, we use one for web server files, one for database files, one for <code class="literal">/tmp</code>, and one for the rest of the disk. The option to use the entire disk with LVM is shown in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="How to do it…" src="img/8840OS_02_06.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">And, similarly, to use a single partition, as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="How to do it…" src="img/8840OS_02_07.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">You can then delete the logical volume and start creating new ones as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="How to do it…" src="img/8840OS_02_08.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Also, start creating new ones in the main volume group that is remaining, as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="How to do it…" src="img/8840OS_02_09.jpg"/></div></li><li class="listitem">You can set partition options individually per each logical volume/partition you create for <code class="literal">/tmp</code>, as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img alt="How to do it…" src="img/8840OS_02_10.jpg"/></div><p>Here's a recap table with our choices for future reference:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom">

There's a sweet spot right now with the amount of innovation happening on storage hardware and the amount of innovation happening on filesystems.

Otherwise you'll be OK with the Standard System Utilities task.</p><p>Also, you will be asked to opt in to popcon, an anonymous survey where the packages you use and install are sent to Debian anonymously for statistical purposes.

The idea here is to install the system first, configure it, and then create an image to replicate to other servers. With imaging, be aware that you need to change the hostname—in <code class="literal">/etc/hosts</code> and <code class="literal">/etc/hostname</code> using the <code class="literal">hostname</code> command—and any other system-specific data.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec15"/>How to do it…</h2></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Preseeding</strong> is one of the faster ways to save time during Debian installation. As with remastering, you install one system, and you extract the answers to the configuration prompts handled through the <code class="literal">debconf</code> program in order for them to be reused in a new installation.</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">You can also create your own preseed files by specifying as many answers as you need using standard tools:<div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>apt-get install debconf-utils</strong>
<strong>debconf-get-selections –installer &gt;preseed.cfg</strong>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Inspect the contents of this file with your favorite editor (<code class="literal">editor preseed.cfg</code>). You will find that questions that were asked on the installer are preceded by <strong>#</strong> and your answers are below. Some answers, such as password, are not included. Also, there are a lot of answers that you don't even remember to be asked about—those are defaults. Finally, you will notice that there is no answer for your partitioning elections, on the basis that you might have different servers with different hardware and different storage to address.</li><li class="listitem">Once you have a preseed file that works, instead of selecting the <strong>Install</strong> option of Debian, you can choose <strong>Advanced options</strong>, and then <strong>Automated install</strong> to specify the URL of your preseed file.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Preparing the APT packaging system for your environment (Simple)</h1></div></div></div><p>APT is a mature part of Debian that became the distribution's most important differentiator for years, enabling hundreds of derivative projects, including Ubuntu. Since free software is distributed by multiple parties, not always in full coordination in terms of packaging formats, release dates, versioning, configuration files, and so on, distributions are expected to put together the broadest set of software that makes sense for most users in a consistent way.</p><p>APT provides an easy, robust way for users to install software and have Debian take care of pulling software from Internet mirrors, sorting out dependencies and conflicts, installing the software and making basic configuration choices. That's why it's important.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>The main configuration file for APT is <code class="literal">/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. In this file you define whether to use binary and source packages, whether to receive security updates and which branch and sections the system uses: main, which has most packages and consists exclusively on free software; contrib, which has software that depends on proprietary software, and non-free, which has redistributable proprietary software that Debian has decided to distribute.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec18"/>How to do it…</h2></div></div></div><p>Using your text editor, open <code class="literal">/etc/apt/sources.list</code> and review the following steps for setting up APT:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">For most web server scenarios, you won't need source repositories, nor contrib and non-free, and you will want to make sure you receive security updates. So, <code class="literal">/etc/apt/sources.list</code> might look as simple as:<div><pre class="programlisting">deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy main
deb http://security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates main</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Changes to this file are not immediately applied. You need to update your APT system, that is, go online and grab the latest list of available software and updates. You achieve that by using the apt-get tool as follows:<div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>apt-get update</strong>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">If you chose a mirror while installing Debian (using netinst), and you have Internet access at that time, this file will be prepopulated for you. If you didn't chose a mirror, you will have the CD as your first repository and <a class="ulink" href="http://security.debian.org">security.debian.org</a> as your second. In that case, you can wipe the file and use the notation indicated previously.</li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec19"/>There's more…</h2></div></div></div><p>There are other configuration options for APT, such as proxies and pinning/preferences, and other operations, such as a system-wide upgrade. These are rarely needed on a production system (things like pinning will be useful but are outside of the scope of this book). We will cover some of them later, but the above steps would suffice to have a configured APT system.</p><p>Also, bear in mind that there are two mainstream tools used to operate the APT system: apt-get and aptitude. We like to think that they're pretty interchangeable but advanced users will develop strong attachments to either one, and you definitely want to standardize from the beginning. This also responds to cycles, five years ago the aptitude was big because of a smarter resolution of dependencies, and so on, and it seems that apt-get has gained traction in the last year or so, mainly driven by Ubuntu. The author was a strong aptitude advocate but finds himself using apt-get lately, especially for this book.</p><p>While operations such as install, remove, update, and dist-upgrade are fairly similar in both systems, aptitude has a better search facility (aptitude search [term]) and an interface that can be useful for handling broken package situations (just type aptitude).</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec12"/>Installing your application platform stack (Simple)</h1></div></div></div><p>Unless you were using the tasks mentioned in the installation recipe, you now have a properly configured server. To make it a web server, you need to install the web server, the database (if you will be hosting one), the programming language/environment, libraries, any web frameworks you're using, and so on. Fortunately, Debian packages several of them for you, and since you have a configured APT system, you can get started faster.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec20"/>How to do it…</h2></div></div></div><p>Although there are a handful of web servers packaged for Debian, there are two schools: Apache and Nginx. They have different execution models—while Nginx is a lightweight, event-oriented server that runs your application via CGI asynchronously, Apache is full of features, more mature with a thread/process approach. You can also have a dual approach where Nginx, designed for concurrency, takes the frontend paired with memcached, and Apache serves the application in the backend.</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In either case, you will need to install the web server using APT.<p>For Apache:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>apt-get install task-web-server #</strong>
</pre></div><p>For Nginx:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>apt-get install nginx #</strong>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">If you install Apache, you will note there are several flavors of it available as different packages; worker is one of the <strong>MPM</strong>s (<strong>Multi Processing Module</strong>) for Apache. You might also want to use prefork since it provides a similar operation model to previous versions of Apache and avoids threads, which might be a problem with non-thread-safe libraries. Simply write <code class="literal">apt-get install task-web-server apache2-mpm-prefork+</code> (think of the plus sign as "I really want this package").</li><li class="listitem">There are two steps for configuring your web server: configure your site or virtual host, and configure your application execution method.</li><li class="listitem">Configuring virtual hosts is very easy in both Apache and Nginx. They both have <code class="literal">sites-available</code> folders (under <code class="literal">/etc/apache2</code> and <code class="literal">/etc/nginx</code> respectively) where you can drop in a bit of configuration corresponding to your host. You can then link that file to the <code class="literal">sites-enabled/</code> folder (or, for Apache, using the a2ensite/a2dissite tool) and reload your server.<p>For Apache:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>service apache2 restart #</strong>
</pre></div><p>For Nginx:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>service nginx restart #</strong>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Configuring the execution method for your application depends on the programming language you are using (Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, and so on). We'll assume PHP. As previously mentioned, while Nginx will run PHP via FastCGI, Apache also offers the possibility of using <code class="literal">mod_php</code>, where PHP is basically embedded in the Apache process. For doing that, you only need to install and enable the <code class="literal">mod_php</code> module:<div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5</strong>
</pre></div><p>For Nginx, the easiest configuration involves spawning a PHP FastCGI process (manually or optionally with an <code class="literal">init</code> script) and setting FastCGI parameters, as described on the Nginx Wiki page (<a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/PHPFcgiExample">http://wiki.nginx.org/PHPFcgiExample</a>). Here, you can find lots of other configuration snippets, including advanced proxying, caching, and specific directives for CMS and other programming languages besides PHP.</p><p>Separating the database from the application server may also make sense since the database is I/O bound but the web application is not—most of the time. But you might not have much hardware, or you might be planning on scaling out with tight application plus database units in volumes. Or you might not be using a conventional database at all. However, let's assume you are.</p></li><li class="listitem">As with the application server, there are two schools for RDBMS: MySQL and PostgreSQL. Debian's default is PostgreSQL but you're free to choose.<div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>apt-get install mysql-server</strong>
</pre></div><p>OR</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>apt-get install postgresql</strong>
</pre></div><p>Configuration involves lots of variables, from performance to security, and while the default configuration works fine for setting up your server, we will provide some pointers later in the book.</p></li><li class="listitem">Finally, you need to install the proper bindings for the programming language you're using; otherwise, the application will not be able to connect to the database. For example:<div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>apt-get install php5-mysql</strong>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Most likely, the interpreter for your language is already installed on Debian (such as Perl, Python) or is readily available (such as PHP through <code class="literal">mod_php</code>, or Ruby, and so on) but some libraries might not be. For example, if your application needs <code class="literal">gd</code> extensions, you can perform:<div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>apt-get install php5-gd</strong>
</pre></div></li></ol></div><p>While you may find frameworks such as Dancer, Rails, or Symfony conveniently packaged in Debian's repositories, they are changing creatures by nature, and most developers download them from the project's website and roll their own outside the APT system. We discuss frameworks briefly later in this book.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec13"/>Setting up your storage, security, and permissions (Simple)</h1></div></div></div><p>As mentioned earlier, partitioning is very important for a web server. You already took your first steps by selecting which directories you wanted partitioned out (hopefully, at least <code class="literal">/tmp</code> and <code class="literal">/var</code> or <code class="literal">/var/www</code>), but now you need to set security and permissions for them.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec21"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>If you will have several profiles for users and groups, this is a good time to review them as you prepare to harden the storage permissions.

Towards the end of it, you will see lines for the partitions you created during installation.</p><div><img alt="How to do it…" src="img/8840OS_06_01.jpg"/></div><p>You can see that we have the <strong>/tmp</strong>, <strong>/var/lib/mysql</strong> and <strong>/var/www</strong> folders partitioned out. In most cases, you won't need to mess with the first column which is the device name (the installer figured it out for you), but you must make sure that:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The mount points are right</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The filesystem in use is the one you want (Debian uses ext4 by default, although many others are available)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The mount options are right: <strong>noatime</strong> or <strong>relatime</strong> (doesn't write to the disk every time the access time changes, which speeds things up. Frankly it's not very useful on web servers, although some Unix tools will expect this behavior), <strong>noexec</strong> (disallows executable files), <strong>nodev</strong> (no special device files allowed), and <strong>nosuid</strong> (no files with elevation of rights enabled)</li></ul></div><p>You will close an important set of attack vectors by applying this basic security measure, as most attackers rely on the <code class="literal">/tmp</code> folder being world writeable to drop and run malicious scripts there. Also, <code class="literal">/var</code> contains <code class="literal">/var/www</code> and <code class="literal">/var/lib/mysql</code> or <code class="literal">/var/lib/postgres</code>, which will benefit from that security measure as well.</p><p>Permissions are also important. On Debian, the Nginx and Apache processes run as a system user called www-data. This user must have read permissions for your application scripts and static files that most likely will be sitting on <code class="literal">/var/www</code>. But unless your application allows uploads or edits to that folder, you don't need write permissions. The following two operations can help you reset permissions:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>chown –R www-data:www-data /var/www # resets owner and group to www-data</strong>
<strong>chmod –R a-w /var/www # removes write permissions for all users on www-data</strong>
</pre></div><p>For MySQL and PostgreSQL, Debian usually defaults to the right thing (<code class="literal">/var/lib/mysql</code> is owned by MySQL) when it comes to storage permissions.</p></div></div>

CREATE DATABASE book;</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">And create a new user called <code class="literal">book</code>, with password <code class="literal">book</code> that can execute all operations on all (current and future) tables of this new database, for example:<div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>GRANT ALL ON book.* TO book@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'book';</strong>
</pre></div><p>Or with Postgres, as the postgres (administrative, equivalent to root in Unix) user:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>su – postgres</strong>
<strong>createuser –P book</strong>
<strong>createdb –O book book</strong>
</pre></div></li></ol></div><p>The <code class="literal">GRANT</code> statement above is not a good idea in production. Can you spot why? First of all, the password is weak—although MySQL will only allow local connections to it, an attacker might plant a password cracker remotely. Second, we're granting <code class="literal">ALL</code> privileges to a single user, which is not a proper etiquette; we could restrict it only to <code class="literal">SELECT</code>, <code class="literal">INSERT</code>, and <code class="literal">UPDATE</code>, and your application could track the state of records to avoid performing <code class="literal">DELETE</code>, for example. Similarly, notice that the <code class="literal">–O</code> option in <code class="literal">createdb</code> for PostgreSQL sets the book as the DB owner, effectively giving the user privileges such as destroying objects.</p><p>This username and password is the one that you will provide to application developers to connect the application to the database. Notice that while it's possible to pass the end user credentials from the application to the database for logging (thus having deeper audit capabilities on the database), it is also complex to set up—the fastest way usually involving the PAM configuration which is beyond the scope of the book.</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Using <code class="literal">mysql –u book –p &lt;database&gt;</code> or <code class="literal">su – book</code> and then <code class="literal">psql&lt;database&gt;</code>, you can access the interactive terminals for both MySQL and PostgreSQL. Similar commands to access the console are available for other DBs such as SQLite or MongoDB.</li><li class="listitem">Your DBAs may also provide you with an archive file, a dump file, or a schema file, which you are expected to load into the database. Small schemas (usually with lots of <code class="literal">CREATE TABLE</code> statements) can usually be copy pasted into the interactive terminal. Larger schemas, or large dump files (with initial data such as <code class="literal">INSERT</code> statements) may need to be loaded via the command line, for example:<div><pre class="programlisting">

In 2012, the author released code for a Perl-based Twitter client that used the Twitter API and the POSIX and MongoDB Perl modules; the author had to change the code in 2013 because a function on POSIX was dropped and the MongoDB syntax for connecting to databases and collections changed.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec30"/>How to do it…</h2></div></div></div><p>While running stable, Debian will not usually push an update that breaks compatibility. But security updates will go through and when enough security updates are issued, those updates are moved into the main repository. Here's a good recipe for staying on top of it:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Install cron-apt with the command <code class="literal">sudo apt-get install cron-apt</code>.</li><li class="listitem">By default, cron-apt is scheduled to run on a maintenance window of 4 A.M. local time; edit this with the sudo editor <code class="literal">/etc/cron.d/cron-apt</code> and change if necessary.</li><li class="listitem">Make sure services are running after the upgrade (for example, by using a browser or database client, or following your internal test procedures).</li><li class="listitem">If you ever need to do a manual upgrade:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">sudo apt-get update</code> will connect to the Internet and download lists with new versions of software</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code> will upgrade the system</li></ul></div></li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec31"/>There's more…</h2></div></div></div><p>A word of caution. If you're using the codename <code class="literal">stable</code> on your <code class="literal">/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file, the <code class="literal">dist-upgrade</code> command will make major changes when a new release comes out. You might want to stick with the codename <code class="literal">wheezy</code> for consistency or be on top of announcements to be prepared.</p><p>In general, upgrades within the same release are fairly safe even for a production environment. And as mentioned earlier, you might choose to not use cron-apt at all. In such cases, you might want to change the default action of cron-apt.</p><p>Bear in mind that kernel upgrades don't require an immediate restart. You might as well keep operating with the old kernel until a proper maintenance window is defined. However, very old kernels can break future upgrades of some system libraries.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec18"/>Backing up your environment (Medium)</h1></div></div></div><p>There are different types of backup. When you think of backing up your environment, it helps to think of how you want to restore it. Do you want to restore it quickly? Do you want to restore it from the bare bones? Do you want to invest more or less time doing the actual restoration process? Do you want to be granular about what you restore?</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec32"/>Getting ready</h2></div></div></div><p>Debian has different software for all those types of backups. You should select the one that you feel comfortable with, and not try to find a feature-by-feature replica of what you had in your old environments, or try to use whatever the rest of the people are using on the Internet.</p><p>For a web server, you usually have two options: bare metal backup and restore or just web server filesystem backup and restore. The former is usually more comprehensive and complex to set up and maintain, and the latter is easier to get running but covers less recovery scenarios.</p><p>In any case, you should also add special considerations for backing up your databases and caches, as they usually store information in memory that needs to be flushed to the disk. In some cases like in Postgres (<a class="ulink" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1216660/see-and-clear-postgres-caches-buffers">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1216660/see-and-clear-postgres-caches-buffers</a>), it is not easy to flush cache manually; you need to stop the database altogether.</p><p>In general, it's best to back up a stopped system. That's why it's important to have a scalability strategy for your application so it can keep running while you back up masters.</p><p>For the bare metal recovery solution, we'll use Bacula. We will also share some tips on how to use rsync for a web backup scenario. The reason why rsync might make sense here is that you don't have a large datacenter with lots of different servers and operating systems; most likely, you have Debian running a web application, with any number of similar hardware running slaves.</p><p>Bacula is distributed, so you can have a director, a storage daemon (server where backups are stored) and several file daemons (clients to be backed up); for the purpose of this guide, we'll consider you have the director and storage together. Also, the director can use different backends for metadata storage. It could make sense to use the same database as your web application to potentially re-use existing DBA skills. We'll use MySQL.</p><p>Besides <code class="literal">/var/www</code> and <code class="literal">/var/lib/mysql</code> or <code class="literal">/var/lib/postgres</code>, you'd usually want to back up several critical folders such as <code class="literal">/etc</code>, which contains configuration for your setup. <code class="literal">/var</code> may also be a good idea especially if you're using other caches or software with variable data. The rest of your system, particularly <code class="literal">/usr</code> and <code class="literal">/lib</code>, are usually not modified and come prepackaged on Debian packages; <code class="literal">/tmp</code> is volatile (clears out with each restart) and <code class="literal">/dev</code> is autogenerated.</p><p>Of course, if you're going with a bare metal strategy, then you recover your setup from the ground up..

Bacula will put a dummy path (something like <code class="literal">/nonexistent/path/</code>…), but you should put something like <code class="literal">/var/backups/restore</code> or something meaningful to you. We chose <code class="literal">/bacula-restores</code>.</p><p>We suggest that Debian users back up their installed package lists and their responses to debconf, the Debian configuration interface.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec20"/>Preparing for common security scenarios (Medium)</h1></div></div></div><p>Running a web server poses very specific security risks. Attackers know that web applications are powered by databases potentially containing profitable information. They also know that nowadays lots of web applications are built on top of open source frameworks, libraries, and execution environments and there's both an open and a black market for knowledge on vulnerabilities and exploits for them.</p><p>Sometimes, attackers just use sheer computing and networking power to slow your application down to a crawl by exhausting all the system resources. This is called a <strong>Denial of Service</strong> (<strong>DoS</strong>) and can evolve into a <strong>Distributed Denial of Service</strong> (<strong>DDoS</strong>) where several computers in several different networks are joining the attack. This can be a very frustrating attack, and one that can also be triggered by an unexpected growth of legitimate users.</p><p>Finally, attacks on web applications are very visible as they can usually emerge as defacements, changes in the appearance, or functionality of the application that can subject the developers to public humiliation. The exploits, and the defacements, usually manifest themselves by modifying files on the filesystem and potentially installing other malware from <strong>Internet Relay Chat</strong> (<strong>IRC</strong>) bouncers to rootkits.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec37"/>Getting started</h2></div></div></div><p>Even in such a bleak scenario, there are some steps that can be taken; for example, setting up a firewall, setting DoS/DDoS control measures, setting up a file modification watchdog, among others. We will cover some of those scenarios here for your convenience, but they are no substitute for a broader security policy and methodologies. For code security, we also refer developers to Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/resources/publications.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/security/sdl/resources/publications.aspx</a>), with several resources available under a Creative Commons license.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec38"/>How to do it…</h2></div></div></div><p>In this section, you will install a Netfilter firewall helper, configure some kernel-level security options, and install a host-based file modification detection system.</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Install FireHOL using the command, <code class="literal">sudo apt-get install firehol</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Run <code class="literal">sudofireholhelpme&gt; /etc/firehol/firehol.conf</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Review the configuration file, and now run <code class="literal">sudo service firehol start</code>.<p>If your SSH server, web server, Bacula File Director, and MySQL/PostgreSQL server have been running on an external interface so far, FireHOL should pick them up and generate exceptions for them. When you run the service <code class="literal">firehol start</code>, the firewall will block everything except for connections to those ports.</p><p>FireHOL uses Netfilter (commonly known as <strong>iptables</strong>), and you can add/remove client/server services from the configuration file as well as add particular iptables rules.</p><p>Although there are no silver bullets for DoS/DDoS, it doesn't mean you shouldn't implement some mitigation procedures. As mentioned before, DoS works because it exhausts your system resources. If you stop allocating some of those resources, you might stay within the operating threshold. There are operating system (network stack) measures and application-level measures that chiefly deal with <strong>Synchronize</strong> (<strong>SYN</strong>) states, a transitional state for legitimate connections but one that attacking connections exploit.</p></li><li class="listitem">Reduce the SYN timeout to get rid of those connections faster, and turn TCP SYN Cookies on to enable the system to take more connections when the SYN queue fills up <code class="literal">sudo editor /etc/sysctl.conf</code>, and add the following:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_syn_recv=30</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1</code></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">Changes to <code class="literal">sysctl.conf</code> can be enforced upon reboot or by running <code class="literal">sudo sysctl –p /etc/sysctl.conf</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Create a new Netfilter chain to limit and block new SYN connections; in this case, we have a limit of 50 initial connections followed by 10 per second:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">iptables -N syn-flood</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">iptables -A syn-flood -m limit --limit 10/second --limit-burst 50 -j RETURN</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">iptables -A syn-flood -j DROP</code></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">When you create a chain, remember to pipe your traffic through this chain.<p>

</p></li></ol></div><p>Regarding filesystem-based security scenarios, one of the main questions is how to stay on top of changes of critical system and application files, and be able to respond timely. RKHunter is a great tool that monitors common files for potential rootkit signatures or changes. It integrates very well with APT, so every time you use APT to install software, it will help you scan the system. In the case that it finds any vulnerability, it will send you a mail (you can check your mail using <code class="literal">sudo mail</code>).</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>sudo apt-get install rkhunter</strong>
</pre></div><p>You can also run with <code class="literal">sudorkhunter –c</code> manually.</p><p>It is recommended to run RKHunter periodically, and during installation, it also offers the possibility to integrate into the APT system (more exactly, the dpkg toolset) to provide automatic scanning during package management operations.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec39"/>There's more…</h2></div></div></div><p>With several different attack vectors in the market and several different open source countermeasures, there might be a temptation to install and run every single tool imaginable. You might want to go up the stack with solutions like mod_evasive that might help at the web server level. But beware, they may also consume large amounts of resources.</p><p>Port scanning is a common information gathering/reconnaissance practice among potential attackers. Mapping the ports that are closed, open, or filtered as well as potentially determining which services are running can save the attackers' time. And when a service like SSH has been identified, password guessing, dictionary, and brute-force attacks can be launched. While going obscure will not make you invulnerable, readily available solutions exist for services like SSH, such as fail2ban, which will preemptively cut off some automated tools executing password attacks. Installation is as easy as executing the command, <code class="literal">sudo apt-get install fail2ban</code>.</p><p>There are lots of other measures that you will need to take to secure your server. From content inspection with tools such as Snort or mod_security to passive and active measures, it can be a task of its own; unfortunately, the book does not cover all potential approaches to web application security.</p></div></div>

Large market share along with insufficient security practices and attack persistency will eventually result in a security breach, especially if attackers have incentives. If you operate a low-profile CMS, most likely you will be defaced. If you operate something for profit in nature, attackers might go for passwords or sensitive data.

This is not a clean shutdown, and you will want to take care of any critical pending operations first. Take the disk(s) out and replicate them using read-only access, ideally using a forensics duplicator.

On a web application, you'd like to take a look at the web server logs (<code class="literal">/var/log/apache2/*</code>, <code class="literal">/var/log/nginx/*</code>), especially for any error lines that might be indicative of an application vulnerability leveraged to inject code or provoke an intrusion. Also, you want to take a look at any seemingly random garbage or erroneous requests that can evidence someone is trying to exploit an error and <code class="literal">/var/log/auth.log</code> containing authentication activity (SSH logins, and so on). In addition to this, you should also look at the <code class="literal">/var/log/wtmp</code>, <code class="literal">/var/log/lastlog</code> and <code class="literal">/var/log/btmp</code> files that can be read with the <code class="literal">last</code> and <code class="literal">lastlog</code> commands and might contain important authentication information.

Also, logs of products such as RKHunter might be helpful.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, for critically modified information such as defaced files, you'd want to check the MAC times. When you use <code class="literal">–l</code>, you get the modification time of a file but by adding <code class="literal">–c</code>, you can check the creation time and with <code class="literal">–u</code>, the access (use) time. Specialized forensic toolkits, such as The Coroner's Toolkit, will help you detect mismatches and timelines if necessary.</li><li class="listitem">In most cases, if you're using a CMS or some other prepackaged web software, you can upgrade your software, themes, and modules (especially third party modules) and check on specialized mailing lists (such as full disclosure) if there are any known security vulnerabilities.

People were upgrading and looking for new features to improve performance—much improvement came to laptops and desktops, and few to servers. Nowadays, lots of mid-market sysadmins prefer to leave the kernel as is in favor of eased management, while top web companies may employ teams that only do kernel optimization. Some vendors might even restrict the amount of kernel customization they can tolerate for support or warranty purposes.</p><p>Yes, faster I/O can add performance value to your server. More bandwidth, faster bus speeds, better RAM technologies, faster disks, storage using fibre, and so on should all be explored. But other solutions, such as horizontally growing by adding more servers for load balancing can also help. It is important to find the right balance between an elastic growth strategy and a manageable architecture. Fortunately, Debian has several free software tools as well as enough customization hooks for you to explore your own approach.</p></div></div></body></html>
