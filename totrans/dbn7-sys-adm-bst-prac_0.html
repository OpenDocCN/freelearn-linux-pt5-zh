<html><head></head><body><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>The Debian Linux distribution is the most stable distribution available, and it is used on more Internet web servers than any other operating system. While there are many instructional web pages and cookbooks written about Linux, and Debian Linux in particular, it is too easy for new users and seasoned administrators to get lost in the details. This book provides a broad overview, more of a what to than a how to, of Debian Linux administration. The chapters are designed to cover the subjects an administrator must address, and include background information, tips and suggestions, and basic knowledge and administration techniques. References are included that cover the various topics in greater detail than can be included in a book of this length.</p><p>Although oriented towards the current Debian stable distribution, the subjects covered are useful for any Linux administrator to know. As for the lack of numerous, detailed examples, I apologize. It is impossible in a book of this length to go as far into details as I would have liked. Fortunately, the Debian Project provides excellent guides and references, as well as online web pages that are pointed out in the text.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
