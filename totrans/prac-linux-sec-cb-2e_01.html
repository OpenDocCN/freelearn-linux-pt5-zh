<p><span>A Linux machine is only as secure as the administrator configures it to be. Once we have installed the Linux distribution of our choice and have removed all the unnecessary packages post installation, we can start working on the security aspect of the system by fine-tuning the installed software and services.</span></p>
<p class="chapter-content">In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuring server security</li>
<li>Security policy—server security</li>
<li>Defining security controls</li>
<li>Missing backup plans</li>
</ul>
<p>The following recipes will be covered in the chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking the integrity of installation medium using checksum</li>
<li>Using LUKS disk encryption</li>
<li>Making use of <kbd>sudoers</kbd>—configuring <kbd>sudo</kbd> access</li>
<li>Scanning hosts with Nmap</li>
<li>Gaining root on a vulnerable Linux system</li>
<li>Missing backup plans</li>
</ul>

<p>When creating a security policy you should keep in mind that it should be simple and easy for all the users to follow. The objective of the policy should be to protect the data while keeping the privacy of the users.</p>
<p>It should be developed around these points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility to the system</li>
<li>Software installation rights on the system</li>
<li>Data permission</li>
<li>Recovery from failure</li>
</ul>
<p>When developing a security policy, a user should be using only those services for which permission has been granted. Anything that is not permitted should be restricted in the policy. Let's look at some common Linux security myths.</p>

<p class="chapter-content">You might feel nervous while planning to use Linux-based systems in your business. This may be due to some false rumors about security in Linux that the systems might have fallen prey to any of the myths out there.</p>

<p>Linux, being a free and open source operating system, has its own advantages. It includes a large base of developers who constantly audit the source code for any possible security risks; t<span>he Linux community can provide fast support and fixes for any potential security problem. Patches are released quickly for testing by the community so they don't have to deal with the clumsy administration that other Unix vendors may have to deal with.</span></p>
<p>D<span>ue to the massive worldwide user base,</span> Linux's security gets tested across huge range of computing environments, thus making it one of the most stable and secure operating systems. As Linux is open to scrutiny by developers across the world, it helps Linux derive superior security in the ways the privileges are assigned. The way in which these privileges are assigned in a Linux system is also a security feature derived from the open source code of the system.</p>

<p>Assuming that Linux is for experts who know how to deal with viruses is a misconception. Linux has evolved to become one of the friendliest OSes that can be used by anyone, whether novice or experts.</p>
<p>Linux is secure because of its strong architecture. Regular users on a Linux system possess low-privileged accounts rather than having root privileges.</p>

<p>Due to its strong architecture, even if a Linux system gets compromised, viruses would not have root access and thus will not be able to cause any major damage to the system.</p>
<p>Even on Linux servers, several levels of security are implemented and they are updated more often, again helping to secure the servers from viruses.</p>
<p>There are still a number of viruses that target Linux, thus making it not completely virus free. But most of the viruses that exist for Linux are non-destructive in nature.</p>

<p class="chapter-content">Once a Linux server is created, the immediate next step is to implement security procedures to make sure that any kind of threat should not cause the system to be compromised. A major reason for malicious attacks on Linux servers have been poorly implemented security or existing vulnerabilities. When configuring a server, the security policies need to be implemented properly to create a secure environment that will help prevent your business from getting hacked.</p>

<ol>
<li>When a Linux server is created, the first user created by default is always the root user. This root user should be used for initial configuration only.</li>
<li>Once initial configuration is done, this root user should be disabled via SSH. This will make it difficult for any hacker to gain access to your Linux machine.</li>
<li>Further, a secondary user should be created to log in and administer the machine. This user can be allowed sudo permissions if administrative actions need to be performed.</li>

<li>Avoid using password combinations that could be easily guessed, such as dictionary words, keyboard patterns, usernames, ID numbers, and so on.</li>

<p>Whenever you download an image file of any Linux distribution, it should always be checked for correctness and safety. This can be done by generating an MD5 hash after downloading the image file and then comparing the generated hash with the hash generated by the organization supplying the image file.</p>
<p>This helps in checking the integrity of the downloaded file. If the original file was tampered with it can be detected using the MD5 hash comparison. The larger the file size, the higher the possibility of changes in the file. It is always recommended you do an MD5 hash comparison for files such as the operating system installation CD.</p>

<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Linux Terminal and then change the directory to the folder containing the downloaded ISO file.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">Because Linux is case sensitive, type the correct spelling for the folder name. Downloads are not the same as downloads in Linux.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>After changing to the download directory, type the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 90px"><strong>md5sum ubuntu-filename.iso</strong></pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">md5sum will then print the calculated hash in a single line as shown here:</p>

<p>If the calculated hash and the hash on the UbuntuHashes page match, then the downloaded file is not damaged. In case the hashes don't match, then there is a possibility that the file might be tampered or is damaged. Try downloading the file again. If the issue still persists, it is recommended you report the issue to the administrator of the server.</p>

<p>Here’s something extra in case you want to go the extra mile: the GUI checksum calculator available for Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it’s really inconvenient to use the Terminal for doing checksums. You need to know the right folder of the downloaded file and also the exact filename. This makes it difficult to remember the exact commands.</p>
<p>As a solution, there is the very small and simple software – <strong>GtkHash</strong>.</p>
<p>You can download the tool here: <a href="http://gtkhash.sourceforge.net/">http://gtkhash.sourceforge.net/</a>.<a href="http://gtkhash.sourceforge.net/"/></p>
<p>Or you can install it by using the following command:</p>

<p class="chapter-content">In enterprises, small business, and government offices, the users may have to secure their systems in order to protect their private data, which includes customers details, important files, contact details, and so on. To help with this, Linux provides a good number of cryptographic techniques that can be used to protect data on physical devices such as hard disk or removable media. One such cryptographic technique is using <strong>Linux Unified Key Setup</strong> (<span><strong>LUKS</strong>)</span>-on-disk-format. This technique allows the encryption of Linux partitions.</p>
<p class="chapter-content">This is what LUKS does<strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The entire block device can be encrypted using LUKS; it's well suited for protecting the data on removable storage media or the laptop disk drives</li>
<li>LUKS uses the existing device mapper kernel subsystem</li>
<li>It also provides passphrase strengthening, which helps protect against dictionary attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>Sudoer is the functionality of the Linux system that can be used by an administrator to provide administrative access to a trusted regular user, without actually sharing the root user's password. The administrator simply needs to add the regular user in the sudoers list.</p>
<p>Once a user has been added to the sudoers list, they can execute any administrative command by preceding it with sudo. Then the user would be asked to enter their own password. After this, the administrative command would be executed the same way as by the root user.</p>

<li>You will first create a normal account and then give it sudo access. Once done, you will be able to use the <kbd>sudo</kbd> command from the new account and then execute the administrative commands. Follow the steps given to configure sudo access.

</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Finally, run the <kbd>whoami</kbd> command with <kbd>sudo</kbd> from the new account. As you have executed a command using <kbd>sudo</kbd> for the first time using this new user account, the default banner message will be displayed for the <kbd>sudo</kbd> command. The screen will also ask for the user account password to be entered:</p>

<p>A vulnerability assessment is the process of auditing your network and system security, through which you can come to know about the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your network. The first phase in vulnerability assessment is reconnaissance, and this further leads to the phase of system readiness, in which we mainly check for all known vulnerabilities in the target. Next follows the phase of reporting in which we group all the vulnerabilities found into categories of low, medium, and high risk.</p>

<p class="chapter-content">Nmap, <span>which can be used for scanning a network,</span> is one of the most popular tools included in Linux. It has been in existence for many years, and is currently one of the preferred tools for gathering information about a network. Nmap can be used by administrators on their networks to find any open ports and the host systems. When performing vulnerability assessments, Nmap is surely a tool not to be missed.</p>

<p class="chapter-content">Most Linux versions come with Nmap installed. The first step is to check whether you already have it by using the following command:</p>
<pre>    <strong>nmap --version</strong></pre>
<p class="chapter-content">If Nmap exists, you should see output similar to this:</p>

<p class="chapter-content">Follow these steps for scanning hosts with Nmap:</p>
<ol>
<li>The most common use of Nmap is to find all the hosts online within a given IP range. The default command used takes some time to scan the complete network, depending on the number of hosts in the network.</li>
<li>The following screenshot shows an example:
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6d0f40a6-9684-4bf9-8dba-0ab67c72254c.png" style="width:36.83em;height:16.67em;"/></div>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>To perform a SYN scan on a particular IP from a subnet, use the following command:
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bfcfa8dc-27e9-4c7e-857a-219e59cf9215.png" style="width:31.42em;height:23.33em;"/></div>
</li>
<li>If SYN scan does not work properly, you can also use Stealth scan:
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e98d5af2-a766-4b63-8bf4-6277d0a4591c.png" style="width:31.00em;height:21.67em;"/></div>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>To detect the version number of the services running on the remote host, you can perform Service Version Detection scan as follows:
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2edf882c-0432-4645-9d68-7aee019184c0.png" style="width:29.17em;height:18.83em;"/></div>
</li>
<li>If you want to detect the operating system running on the remote host, run the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>nmap -O 192.168.1.102</strong></pre>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign" style="padding-left: 60px"><img src="assets/538f3a50-00ef-404a-a8e2-4de873a3e642.png" style="font-size: 1em;width:30.50em;height:22.58em;"/></div>

</li>
<li>If you wish to scan only for a particular port, such as <kbd>80</kbd>, run the command:
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9fdc5fa0-42c5-4377-81bf-e4f892b59866.png" style="width:37.08em;height:11.33em;"/></div>

<p class="chapter-content">When trying to learn how to scan and exploit a Linux machine, one major problem we encounter is where to try. For this purpose, the Metasploit team has developed and released a virtual machine called <em>Metasploitable</em>. This machine has been made vulnerable purposefully, having many services running unpatched. Due to this, it has become a great platform for practicing or developing penetration testing skills. In this section, we will learn how to scan a Linux system and then, using the scanning result, how to find a service that is vulnerable. Using that vulnerable service, we shall gain root access to the system.</p>

<p>The Metasploit Framework is an open source tool used by security professionals globally to perform penetration tests by executing exploit code on target systems from within the framework. It comes pre-installed with Kali Linux (the preferred choice of distribution for security professionals).</p>
<p>Follow these steps to gain root access to a vulnerable Linux system:</p>
<ol>
<li>First open the Metasploit console on the Kali system by running the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre><strong>service postgresql start</strong><br/><strong>msfconsole</strong></pre>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2dd9b486-0260-495a-93cd-b1df58aef53d.png" style="width:53.83em;height:42.25em;"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>At the bottom of the screen, you should get the Metasploit framework prompt denoted by <kbd>msf&gt;</kbd><span class="packt_screen">.</span></li>
<li>Next, we need to scan the target, which is <kbd>192.168.0.102</kbd> in this example, using Nmap:</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign" style="padding-left: 60px"><span>The following screenshot shows the output of the command:</span></p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign" style="padding-left: 30px"><img src="assets/c45f87d1-d84e-4f21-8fcc-6e9cce8ae326.png" style="text-align: center;color: black;font-size: 1em;width:36.58em;height:23.58em;"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>In the previous command, you can see there are many services running on different ports. Among them you can see FTP is also running on port <kbd>21</kbd>.</li>
<li>We will focus on the FTP service for now. From the output shown, you can see that the FTP service is provided by the vsftpd application version 2.3.4.</li>
<li>Now lets <span>try to find an exploit for</span> <kbd>vsftpd</kbd> <span>within the Metasploit framework by simply executing the command <kbd>search</kbd></span> <kbd>vsftpd.</kbd> Here is the output:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/da12ffaa-43b9-4a7a-9dbb-08dce8378529.png" style="text-align: center;font-size: 1em;width:66.00em;height:14.58em;"/></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>The search results are showing a module, VSFTPD Backdoor Command Execution, with an excellent rating, which means that this exploit will work perfectly fine.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>Now run the following commands to use the exploit and check its options:
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/00538b6b-cc3d-4fb6-bf02-5f2b8cd9e63e.png" style="font-size: 1em;text-align: center;width:35.17em;height:18.67em;"/></div>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li>As you can see from the screenshot, you need to set the value of <kbd>RHOST</kbd>, which is <kbd>192.168.1.102</kbd> in our case.</li>
<li>Set the value for <kbd>RHOST</kbd> and then run the exploit as shown here:</li>
</ol>
<div class="chapter-content CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/cb65f99b-068b-4222-a564-394a8002ff95.png" style="width:60.92em;height:19.92em;"/></div>
<ol start="11">
<li class="chapter-content">Once the exploit runs successfully, you will get root access, as shown in the preceding screenshot.</li>

<p class="chapter-content">We first did an Nmap scan to check for running services and open ports and found the FTP service running. Then we tried to find the version of the FTP service. Once we got the information, we searched for any exploit available for VSFTPD. The VSFTPD backdoor module that was found in the search result is actually a code that is being sent to the target machine by the Metasploit framework. The code gets executed on the target machine due to a module of the VSFTPD being improperly programmed. Once the code gets executed, we get a root shell access on our Kali machine</p>
<p class="chapter-content">Using the exploit found for VSFTPD, we tried to attack the target system and got the root shell on it.</p>
