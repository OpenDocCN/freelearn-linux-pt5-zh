There have been many events since I taught my first course at Sun Microsystems at the beginning of 2001 (at that time, I worked on Sun Solaris 7). Nowadays, I am thankful to keep learning more about this outstanding operating system from many excellent professionals around the world who could have written this book.</p><p class="calibre7">I have to confess that I am a big fan of Oracle Solaris, and my practical experience of so many years has shown me that it is still the best operating system in the world and, for a while, it has also been incomparable. When anyone talks about performance, security, consistency, features, and usability, it always takes me to same point: Oracle Solaris.</p><p class="calibre7">It is likely that there will be people who disagree and I can try to explain my point of view, attacking other good operating systems such as Linux, AIX, HP-UX, and even Windows, but it will not be very effective or polite. Instead, I think it is more suitable to teach you the advanced features of Oracle Solaris and its use cases, and you can make your own conclusions.</p><p class="calibre7">Oracle has invested a lot of money in Oracle Solaris that has been improved a lot because many good and advanced features have been introduced since then and it is at this point that this book begins.</p><p class="calibre7">
<em class="calibre11">Oracle Solaris 11 Advanced Administration Cookbook</em> aims to show and explain dedicated procedures about how to execute daily tasks on the Oracle Solaris 11 system on a step-by-step basis, where every single command is tested and its output is shown. Additionally, this book will be committed to reviewing a few key topics from Oracle Solaris 11 intermediate administration, and all the concepts from basic and advanced administration will be introduced according to need in order to help the reader understand obscure points.</p><p class="calibre7">While I was writing this book, I learned a lot and tested different scenarios and ways to bring you only the essential concepts and procedures, given that all commands and outputs came from my own lab. By the way, the entire book was written using an x64 machine because most people have difficulties in accessing SPARC-based systems.</p><p class="calibre7">Finally, I hope you have a great time reading this book as well, just like I had while I was writing it. I hope you enjoy it!</p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03" class="calibre1"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">I am sure you know how to install Oracle Solaris 11 very well. Nevertheless, it is pertinent to show you how to configure a simple environment to execute each procedure of this book. A well-done environment will help us to draw every concept and understanding from this book by executing all the commands, examples, and procedures. In the end, you should remember that this a practical book!</p><p class="calibre7">To follow this recipe, it is necessary to have a physical machine with at least 8 GB RAM and about 80 GB of free space on the hard disk. Additionally, this host should be running operating system that is compatible with and supported by the VMware or VirtualBox hypervisor software, including processors such as Intel or AMD, which support hardware virtualization. You are also required to have a working Solaris 11 that will be installed and configured as a virtual machine (VMware or VirtualBox).</p><p class="calibre7">To get your environment ready, you have to execute the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1"> First, you should download Oracle Solaris 11 from the Oracle website (<a class="calibre1" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris11/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris11/downloads/index.html</a>). It is appropriate to pick the <em class="calibre11">Oracle Solaris 11 Live Media for x86</em> method because it is easier than the <em class="calibre11">Text Installer</em> method, and it allows us to bring up the Oracle Solaris 11 from DVD before starting the installation itself. For example, if we are using a physical machine (not a virtual one as is usually used), it provides us with a utility named <em class="calibre11">Device Driver Utility</em> that checks whether Oracle Solaris 11 has every driver software for the physical hardware. Nonetheless, if we want to install Oracle Solaris 11 on a SPARC machine, then the <em class="calibre11">Text Installer</em> method should be chosen.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">We should download all the pieces from the Oracle Solaris repository images and concatenate them into a single file (<code class="email"># cat part1 part2 part3 … &gt; sol-11-repo-full.iso</code>). This final image will be used in <a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 1. IPS and Boot Environments" href="part0015_split_000.html#page">Chapter 1</a>, <em class="calibre11">IPS and Boot Environments</em>, when we talk about how to configure an IPS local repository.</li><li class="listitem" value="3">Later in this book, how to configure <em class="calibre11">Oracle Solaris 11 Automatic Installation</em> will be explained, so it is recommended that you take out time to download <em class="calibre11">Oracle Solaris 11 Automated </em>Installer image for DVD for x86 from <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris11/downloads/install-2245079.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris11/downloads/install-2245079.html</a>.</li><li class="listitem" value="4">It is necessary to get some virtualization tool to create virtual machines for Oracle Solaris 11 installation, such as VMware Workstation (<a class="calibre1" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/workstation-evaluation">http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/workstation-evaluation</a>) or Oracle VirtualBox that can be downloaded from <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a>.</li><li class="listitem" value="5">Unfortunately, it is not possible to give details about how to install Oracle Solaris 11 in this book. However, there is a good article that explains and shows a step-by-step procedure at <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-admin/solaris-install-borges-1989211.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-admin/solaris-install-borges-1989211.html</a> from Oracle Technical Network (OTN).</li><li class="listitem" value="6">It is helpful to remember that during the LiveCD GUI installation method, the root user is always configured as a role, and this action is different from the <em class="calibre11">Text Installer</em> method that allows us to choose whether the root user will or will not be configured as a role.</li><li class="listitem" value="7">Just in case the reader does not remember how to change the root role back to work as a user again, we can execute the following command:<div><pre class="programlisting">root@solaris11:/#  <strong class="calibre8">su - root</strong>
root@solaris11:/#  <strong class="calibre8">rolemod  -K  type=normal  root</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre16">Afterwards, it is necessary to log out and log on to the system again for using the root user.</p></li><li class="listitem" value="8">Finally, we recommend you verify that Oracle Solaris 11 is working well by running the following commands:<div><pre class="programlisting">root@solaris11:/# <strong class="calibre8">svcs  network/physical</strong>
