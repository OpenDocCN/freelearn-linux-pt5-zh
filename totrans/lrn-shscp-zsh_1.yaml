    expect from a modern shell, so things such as command history, completion, and
    autocorrection will not wow you as much as someone who just discovered Bash. However,
    unlike some of the other available shells out there, Z shell (zsh) boasts of a
    really powerful scripting language and an incredible completion system. Actually,
    incredible doesn't even begin to describe it. Swift and effortless sounds a bit
    more appropriate. Zsh also incorporates—and arguably, improves on—many of the
    useful features of Bash, ksh, and csh, even going so far as to allow you to emulate
    these shells in your scripts for an extra layer of compatibility.

    started with it, shall we?

    at some of the features that make it unique. Before we embark on our adventure
    though, we will need to install and configure our new shell, so we can ensure
    everything is up and running smoothly. We then move on to the configuration—what
    are the startup files, and how to use the different styles, escape sequences,
    and conditional expressions in order to customize the prompt.

    previous shell, it can be quite a headache trying to figure out the different
    rules set, so it can be ported to zsh. Luckily, zsh provides a series of tools
    for making the switch a more or less smooth experience. Located under `<zshFolder>/Misc`,
    you can use the `bash2zshprompt` or `c2z` scripts to migrate your Bash or csh
    preferences respectively. Note, however, that some distributions might be missing
    this, in which case you should head straight to the official repo and get your
    hands on a local copy. See the *Compiling from source* section for more information

    Although you probably won't have to worry about dealing with them in most usage

    a more detailed description of each of them, I suggest you take a look at `man

    (also `$prompt`). Rest assured though, both (actually the three of them, that
    is) are the same beast and are treated equally by zsh. Then there's `$RPS1` that
    prints a prompt at the right-hand side of the screen. Unlike other prompts though,
    it automatically disappears whenever line width is needed.
  prefs: []

    at the start of some unfinished syntactic structure or when you add inline comments
    to the command line. `$PS3` is used for making choices within a `select` loop
    control mechanism. Last but not the least, `$PS4` really comes in handy for debugging

    the current working directory. Most escape sequences are defined with a modulo
    or percent (`%`) operator, and some of them even take optional parameters to extend
