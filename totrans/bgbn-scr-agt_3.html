While chip manufacturers may provide a laundry list of advantages, there are two main categories: cryptographic acceleration and key isolation features.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch03lvl3sec09" class="calibre1"/>Offloading computation to a separate processor</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">One advantage of using a <a id="id215" class="calibre1"/>dedicated cryptographic co-processor is to offload computation to reduce CPU usage. A typical example is using hardware to perform the<a id="id216" class="calibre1"/> <strong class="calibre8">Advanced Encryption Standard</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">AES</strong>) encryption and decryption operations in a <a id="id217" class="calibre1"/>
<strong class="calibre8">Transport Layer Security</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">TLS</strong>) session.</p><p class="calibre7">TLS is most commonly used in conjunction with the <strong class="calibre8">Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">HTTPS</strong>)<a id="id218" class="calibre1"/> protocol. You use HTTPS every time you buy something online to protect your credit card information. Depending on your browser, you may notice a lock icon or a green bar to indicate when a web page is served over HTTPS. In a TLS session, the client, your browser, and the server will negotiate to use the same symmetric key. While there are several symmetric ciphers that can be negotiated, AES is one of the preferred choices.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note18" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">While some sites automatically redirect you to the HTTPS version of the site, often you must manually specify this. Remembering to type <code class="email">https://</code> is often annoying but fortunately there is a cross-browser plugin that will automatically redirect you to the HTTPS site, if there is one. The plugin is called <strong class="calibre8">HTTPS Everywhere</strong>
<a id="id219" class="calibre1"/> and it is maintained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Information and links to download the free software are located <a id="id220" class="calibre1"/>at <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere</a>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">In the crypto accelerator role, a cryptographic co-processor would perform the encryption and decryption of each TLS record. This offloads the main CPU to handle the processing of the network traffic and perform the intended application. The BBB actually has such a cryptographic co-processor. <strong class="calibre8">Texas Instruments </strong>(<strong class="calibre8">TI</strong>)<a id="id221" class="calibre1"/> crypto performance page for the AM335x, the processor on the BBB, shows the results of their benchmark tests with OpenSSL. Using AES with a 256 bit key size and operating on blocks of 8192 bytes, the measured throughput of data was 8129.19 kB/sec without using crypto acceleration. This test resulted in a CPU usage of 69 percent. However, using the crypto co-processor on the AM335x, they measured a throughput of 24376.66 kB/sec with a <a id="id222" class="calibre1"/>CPU usage of 41 percent. That's almost a 200 percent gain in throughput performance and a 40 percent drop in CPU usage!</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note19" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">More information on the crypto accelerators on the AM335x can be found on TI Crypto <a id="id223" class="calibre1"/>Performance page at <a class="calibre1" href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/AM335x_Crypto_Performance">http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/AM335x_Crypto_Performance</a>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">If your embedded application's purpose is to perform a computationally intense calculation, using a cryptographic co-processor designed to offload the crypto processing can save your CPU cycles for your main program.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch03lvl3sec10" class="calibre1"/>Protecting keys through physical isolation</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">A major advantage of <a id="id224" class="calibre1"/>using hardware cryptography devices is that keys can be generated internal to the device and are designed to be difficult to remove. In the web server world, these devices are called <a id="id225" class="calibre1"/>
<strong class="calibre8">Hardware Security Modules</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">HSMs</strong>). In April 2014, a major vulnerability was announced that affected the OpenSSL software, colloquially called<a id="id226" class="calibre1"/> <strong class="calibre8">heartbleed</strong>. The vulnerability was not a cryptographic one <em class="calibre9">per se</em>, but rather the result of a programming error called a<a id="id227" class="calibre1"/> <strong class="calibre8">buffer overrun</strong>. This vulnerability is unfortunately common in the C programming language, in which OpenSSL is written, because of the lack of automatic array bounds checking. It was possible for a client to exploit this error and view internal memory of the server, potentially discovering sensitive information. The code to fix this problem was shorter than this paragraph.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note20" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">The following <code class="email">xkcd</code> comic<a id="id228" class="calibre1"/> provides a succinct and amusing explanation of the heartbleed bug:</p><p class="calibre7">
<a class="calibre1" href="https://xkcd.com/1354/">https://xkcd.com/1354/</a>
</p></div><p class="calibre7">The scale and severity of this vulnerability cannot be overstated. The most damaging attack is if the server's private key was leaked. Knowing the private key, an attacker can impersonate the server, and clients could willingly disclose private information to the impostor. However, on a server with a HSM, the heartbleed vulnerability was more limited. Sensitive information, such as session cookies, would still have leaked via the software exploit. Yet the server's private key, which remains in the HSM, would not have leaked.</p><p class="calibre7">Since the <a id="id229" class="calibre1"/>hardware cryptographic co-processor runs as a physically separate machine, it is very difficult for software exploits running on the main processor to disclose secrets in the hardware module. In the embedded world, there are several chips that perform this key isolation feature.</p></div></div></div></div>

In the following sections, we'll discuss some of the downsides to using cryptographic hardware and some of the concerns you would need to resolve when using them in your project.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch03lvl3sec11" class="calibre1"/>Lacking cryptographic flexibility</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">A hardware cryptographic<a id="id231" class="calibre1"/> device is generally not configurable. This is usually by design but the implication is that it is difficult, if not impossible, to alter the cryptographic behavior of the device. If you select a chip that performs encryption with a limited key size, you will not be able to upgrade the device with a stronger key size later. It is generally easier to update software-based encryption systems.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch03lvl3sec12" class="calibre1"/>Exposing hardware-specific attack vectors</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">While an isolated crypto <a id="id232" class="calibre1"/>processor may reduce attacks or exploits from the software, it often allows more sophisticated hardware-based attacks. There are three categories of hardware-based attacks: noninvasive, invasive, and semi-invasive (Skoroboga, 2011). Noninvasive attacks treat the chip as a black box and attempt to manipulate the surrounding environment to perform an exploit. Successful non-invasive attacks include performing a <strong class="calibre8">Differential Power Analysis</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">DPA</strong>)<a id="id233" class="calibre1"/> to monitor the chip as it performs an encryption algorithm. By measuring the power usage during the encryption operation, it is possible to see the key through distinct power signatures. An invasive attack usually involves physically destroying the chip in some manner to gain access to its internals. Semi-invasive attacks may involve some sort of laser<a id="id234" class="calibre1"/> imaging to observe or interfere with the chip.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note21" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">To perform a glitch attack, an attack attempts to manipulate the executing instruction by injecting a fault (Bar-El, 2004). Colin O'Flynn, a security researcher, has a concise and clear example of how a glitch attack<a id="id235" class="calibre1"/> can cause a password-checking microprocessor to fail: <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ruphw9-8JWE&amp;list=UUqc9MJwX_R1pQC6A353JmJg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ruphw9-8JWE&amp;list=UUqc9MJwX_R1pQC6A353JmJg</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch03lvl3sec13" class="calibre1"/>Obfuscating implementation details</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">A final consideration is that while<a id="id236" class="calibre1"/> chip vendors may publish the interface to their device, the internals are often proprietary. This is similar to a software vendor who publishes the software programming interface, but provides only the compiled binary and not the source code. In this case, the chip is treated as a black box, and without a mechanism to verify the device, you have to trust that it is operating correctly. As cryptographic libraries are ported to unique microcontrollers by the open source community, this situation will hopefully improve.</p></div></div></div></div>

As with most <a id="id237" class="calibre1"/>complex technologies the correct answer is: <em class="calibre9">it depends</em>. For a truly embedded system, one that can't spare even a few extra bytes, a hardware security chip may be your only option if you can't upgrade your microprocessor. Also, if there is a high threat of leaking your key due to a software vulnerability, then the separate crypto co-processor might help you. However, if an attacker can gain physical access to your device, then they might be able to extract the key with hardware-based attacks. Lastly, if transparency is paramount for you to verify the lack or existence of backdoors, then only fully open source software and hardware devices will satisfy you.</p></div></div></div>

I2C was developed by Phillips Semiconductor over 20 years ago, but it is still very prevalent in electronics design today. I2C requires two signal lines, one for a <strong class="calibre8">Serial Clock</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">SCL</strong>)<a id="id252" class="calibre1"/> and the other for <a id="id253" class="calibre1"/>
<strong class="calibre8">Serial Data</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">SDA</strong>). Devices attached to the bus are either classified as master or slave. Each slave device has an address and there can be more than one master. The I2C protocol supports collision detection and is a true multimaster protocol.</p><p class="calibre7">The SDA and SCL lines are <em class="calibre9">pulled up</em> to the system voltage, VCC, typically with resistors connected from VCC to SDA and VCC to SCL. The processor on the BBB, the AM335x, contains internal pull-up resistors for the bus. Data is encoded to the bus by manipulating the logic levels of the SDA and SCL lines. For example, to start sending data, the master pulls SDA low while holding SCL at a logic high. The stop condition is sent with a low to high transition of SDA while holding SCL high.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note22" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">Revision 6 of the I2C bus specification<a id="id254" class="calibre1"/> can be found on NXP semiconductors (previously Phillips) website at <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/UM10204.pdf">http://www.nxp.com/documents/user_manual/UM10204.pdf</a>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">The following screenshot shows<a id="id255" class="calibre1"/> a normal I2C operation as captured by a logic analyzer.

After all, the BeagleBone has a 2GB eMMC on the early revisions and a 4GB eMMC on revision C. An extra 256 kB of memory is hardly food scraps for the beagle. However, it serves a greater purpose; it's what enables automatic cape detection by the BBB.</p><p class="calibre7">The BBB has two 46 pin female expansion ports offering much more I/O capabilities than any other hobbyist board on the market. Certain pins can actually support eight different modes, mode 0 through mode 7. The mapping of pin features to a mode is known as <a id="id259" class="calibre1"/>
<strong class="calibre8">pin muxing</strong>, short for pin multiplexing. To use a pin in a certain mode, the software must enable and configure this pin through the kernel's interface. This can be manually performed or scripted, but the easiest method is to use a BeagleBone cape.</p><p class="calibre7">During the kernel startup, the software will probe the I2C bus looking for cape EEPROMs. There are four valid addresses for Cape EEPROMs, 0x54 through 0x57. Therefore, the BBB supports up to four attached capes. The BBB will read the cape EEPROM, which must be programmed using the format in the BBB <a id="id260" class="calibre1"/>
<strong class="calibre8">System Reference Manual</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">SRM</strong>). The BBB, using a software package called the <strong class="calibre8">capemgr</strong>,
<a id="id261" class="calibre1"/> short for <strong class="calibre8">Cape Manager</strong>, will read the board name and revision from the Cape EEPROM. It will then try to match the name and revision to a compiled device tree fragment on your BBB. If there is a match, it will load that fragment.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note23" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">The latest production files<a id="id262" class="calibre1"/> for the BBB including the schematics and the SRM are located on the BBB wiki at <a class="calibre1" href="http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack">http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack</a>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">This automatic configuration provides two benefits. The first is that the pins on the BBB are automatically configured for a cape. The second is that the device tree can specify the kernel driver for the hardware on the cape, which means that the drivers for your hardware can be automatically loaded. The <code class="email">capemgr</code> provides a plug-and-play like experience for embedded Linux.</p><p class="calibre7">If you are developing a BeagleBone cape, you should consider the process to have your cape supported in the BeagleBone images. This is a three-step process. First, you need to create a cape EEPROM file. This file should be written to your cape at manufacturing time. Second, you need to create a <strong class="calibre8">Device Tree Source</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">DTS</strong>)<a id="id263" class="calibre1"/> file, following the cape naming convention previously discussed, and submit a pull request on GitHub to BeagleBoard.org. Lastly, you need to create an eLinux wiki site discussing your cape. In the next sections, we'll briefly describe the software and hardware required to build a BeagleBone cape using the CryptoCape as an example.</p></div>

The essential reference to populating the EEPROM is the BeagleBone SRM's section on <em class="calibre9">Cape Board Support</em>. This section contains the EEPROM format. To jumpstart your EEPROM file creation, you can use a tool called the <strong class="calibre8">EEPROM cape generator</strong> <a id="id265" class="calibre1"/>available at: <a class="calibre1" href="https://github.com/picoflamingo/BBCape_EEPROM">https://github.com/picoflamingo/BBCape_EEPROM</a>. This tool with its simple command-line interface will provide the skeleton for your cape EEPROM. Currently, it does not completely implement the cape specification, so you must use a binary editor to set the remaining values of the EEPROM. The process to create the EEPROM binary involves reading through the SRM and writing the appropriate values, at the correct offsets, in a binary file.</p><p class="calibre7">You can view the CryptoCape's EEPROM by executing the following command as root:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">

Specialized devices may not need to know the time to perform their function. However, in security protocols, accurate time keeping is often important. For example, in TLS, the X.509 certificates that are used to prove the identity of web servers contain a validity range. There is a <em class="calibre9">not before</em> and <em class="calibre9">not after</em> time that specifies when that certificate is valid. Without an accurate time keeping system, a device can't enforce this date range allowing it to possibly accept expired or not yet valid certificates.</p><p class="calibre7">If you use your BBB in an offline environment, but still need accurate time, then you can insert a coin cell battery into the battery compartment of the CryptoCape.

<strong class="calibre8">ATmega328p</strong>, which <a id="id300" class="calibre1"/>is the same <a id="id301" class="calibre1"/>microcontroller on the Arduino UNO. However, because the supply voltage is 3.3V and not 5V like the Arduino UNO, the processor runs at a clock speed of 8MHz versus 16Mhz. In this sense, it is more like the 3.3V Arduino Pro Mini. Shipped from SparkFun, the CryptoCape contains the 3.3V Arduino Pro Mini bootloader. Like any other Arduino-based board, you can reflash the bootloader by attaching an <strong class="calibre8">In-System Programming</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">ISP</strong>)<a id="id302" class="calibre1"/> programmer to the ISP headers next to the ATmega328p. SparkFun's pocket programmer<a id="id303" class="calibre1"/> is an inexpensive tool to perform this task. Just be sure to set the switch to <em class="calibre9">no power target</em> since the CryptoCape is powered from the BBB.</p><p class="calibre7">While you can use an ISP programmer, you can also use the BBB as a programmer. The BBB contains both serial UART and SPI; however, only the serial UART, UART 4, is connected to the onboard ATmega328p. Like the Arduino UNO, if the microprocessor is reset, it will accept uploaded programs over the serial line.</p><p class="calibre7">A simple script that toggles the BBB GPIO connected to ATmega's reset line, which is GPIO 49 for the CryptoCape, and then uploads the hex file using <code class="email">avrdude</code> will do the trick. The script is part of a GitHub repository which can be cloned with the command:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre8">git clone https://github.com/jbdatko/BBB_ATmega328P_flasher.git</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">In this repository, there is an <code class="email">upload.sh</code> script, the main logic of which contains the following code snippet:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">(echo 0 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio49/value \
    &amp;&amp; sleep $tts \
    &amp;&amp; echo 1 &gt; \

avrdude -c arduino -p m328p -b 57600 -v \
    -P /dev/ttyO4 -U flash:w:$1</pre></div><p class="calibre7">The first part toggles the ATmega reset line low and sleeps for <code class="email">$tts</code>, which is currently defined to be .9 seconds. Then the script sets the reset line back to high to let the ATmega run. The next line is the <code class="email">avrdude</code> command to upload your hex file. You'll need to install <code class="email">avrdude</code> with the following command:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre8">sudo apt-get install avrdude</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Then, to run the script, perform the following:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre8">sudo ./upload Blink.cpp.hex</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Prior to flashing an Arduino sketch, you must have a sketch to flash. Depending on your development preference, there are several options. You can build your AVR program on the BBB with a makefile and <code class="email">gcc-avr</code>. Or you can build your program with Atmel's free AVR Studio or the Arduino IDE. Whichever way you choose, you need to find the compiled <code class="email">hex</code> file and download it to the BBB using <code class="email">sftp</code> or a similar tool.</p><p class="calibre7">Before you <a id="id304" class="calibre1"/>upload sketches to the CryptoCape's ATmega, you'll<a id="id305" class="calibre1"/> need to perform one very important step: you need to attach jumpers to the two <em class="calibre9">Program Jumper</em> pins. Without the jumpers, the ATmega is not electrically connected to the BBB serial lines. This is a security feature. Using the Arduino bootloader, it is possible to upload <code class="email">hex</code> files using serial UART. Thus, with the jumpers installed, the sketch on the CryptoCape's ATmega can always be modified. Now imagine if the BBB was inflicted with malware, but had the jumpers removed. This malware can't change the software on the ATmega. It can still do lots of other nasty things including resetting the ATmega, but it can't upload new firmware unless the jumpers are attached.</p></div>

This device<a id="id308" class="calibre1"/> contains an optical sensor for reading the fingerprints but also an ARM Cortex M3 processor for computing the image recognition. The interface to this device is via serial UART, using 3.3V level logic, and at a baud rate of 9600 bps. There are four wires to connect from the JST connector: transmit, receive, GND, and power.</p><p class="calibre7">The datasheet states that the false acceptance rate is less than .001 percent and the false rejection rate is less than .1 percent. In short, this is a very capable fingerprint sensor. The fingerprint data is analyzed and stored on this device. We will use an existing library to communicate with this hardware.</p></div></div>

A common critic against using fingerprint sensors centers around the fact that it is difficult for you to change your fingerprint. Once your fingerprint is copied you can't revoke or change it as you can with a password. Using a fingerprint as a two-factor mechanism slightly reduces the risk of an authentication breach since a pin or password is still required. You can also mitigate the risk of a fake fingerprint attack on your sensor by stationing an armed guard to watch the sensor as Bruce Schneier, a security technologist, stated in a September 2013 opinion article in WIRED magazine. Such luxuries are often limited to deep-pocketed governments.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note26" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">
<em class="calibre9">Mythbusters</em>, a popular science<a id="id311" class="calibre1"/> and engineering program on the Discovery Channel, busted the myth that fingerprints could not be copied and showed how to defeat fingerprint sensors: <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hji3kp_i9k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Hji3kp_i9k</a>. Also, days after the Apple iPhone 5s was released, the biometrics hacking team of the <a id="id312" class="calibre1"/>
<strong class="calibre8">Chaos Computer Club</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">CCC</strong>) <a id="id313" class="calibre1"/>showed how to bypass the fingerprint sensor: <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2013/ccc-breaks-apple-touchid">http://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2013/ccc-breaks-apple-touchid</a>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">Perhaps the <a id="id314" class="calibre1"/>greatest danger<a id="id315" class="calibre1"/> of biometric systems is the potential for a grave privacy breach. A database of fingerprints should be well protected since once the fingerprints are exposed they are no longer useful for any other biometric system, <em class="calibre9">ever</em>. In August 2014, Hold Security, an information security forensics company, reported to the <em class="calibre9">New York Times</em> that over 1.2 billion usernames and passwords were acquired by a Russian crime organization. While incredibly damaging, this breach would be irrecoverable if fingerprint biometrics were used. Hopefully, companies aren't storing fingerprints directly but representations of the fingerprint similar to a hash digest. However, if implemented poorly, the results can be as disastrous as storing the raw fingerprint.</p><p class="calibre7">With these warnings in mind, we will continue with using a fingerprint sensor for this project. You'll gain insight on how a fingerprint sensor works and how to it fits into an authentication system. When you are finished with this project, however, you should probably delete your fingerprint from the sensor's database.</p></div></div>

This will allow us to connect various external components. While you could directly solder to the pads, it's best if you solder a male 0.1" pin, which will allow you to easily connect a female terminated wire for your project, which can then be reused.</p><p class="calibre7">A fully populated CryptoCape will look like the following image. A strip of breakaway headers of 31 pins or more will be enough to populate each pad. Technically, you don't need to populate the EEPROM write protect pads unless you want to write to the EEPROM. However, if you overwrite the EEPROM cape information, the BBB might not load the correct <a id="id317" class="calibre1"/>drivers.</p><div><img src="img/00013.jpeg" alt="Preparing the CryptoCape" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div></div>

The CryptoCape has 0.1" pads, which will fit 0.1" male headers and female-to-female jumper wires fit nicely to that connection. One end of the JST connector is simply four bare wires. If you solder each of these wires to a 4x1 0.1" male header, you can make a simple connector. Using a third hand, you can solder the JST wires to the headers and for a finishing touch, add heat-shrink around the wire and the male pin. Just remember to put your heat shrink on before you solder! The completed connector should look something like this:</p><div><img src="img/00014.jpeg" alt="Preparing the connections" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div></div>

The Arduino compatible library for this sensor was developed by Josh Hawley. This library is configured to use digital pin 4 for the receive pin on the ATmega and digital pin 5 as the transmit pin from the ATmega. These pins are appropriately labeled <em class="calibre9">D4</em> and <em class="calibre9">D5</em> on the CryptoCape, just under the ATmega. The remaining two pins are 3.3V power and ground which are also on the same row as the D4 and D5 pins. Attach the female ends of the jumper wires to these pins. If you are using the SparkFun JST connector, the pins from the fingerprint scanner are in the following order, starting with the black wire: D4, D5, GND, Power.</p></div></div>

<strong class="calibre8">enrollment</strong>. There are several methods to enroll your fingerprint. The SparkFun website has instructions on how to use the ADH-Tech provided Windows-based software to program the sensor. However, you'll need an extra component, that is, the FTDI Basic Breakout board to convert USB from your computer to serial for the scanner. You could also use an Arduino directly, but you must also use logic level converters if you are using a 5V Arduino. Since the CryptoCape has an Arduino compatible processor, we will show you how to do this with your BBB and CryptoCape. The repository that contains the ATmega firmware can be cloned on your BBB with the following command:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre8">git clone https://github.com/jbdatko/Fingerprint_Scanner-TTL.git</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">In this repository, the <code class="email">FPS_Enroll.ino</code> file will enroll, or add, a fingerprint to the sensor's database. As <a id="id322" class="calibre1"/>previously mentioned, you'll need to compile this file out of band. Alternatively, you can use the pre-compiled version in the repository above.</p><p class="calibre7">Upload the enroll script:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">

Specifically, it will prevent access to the chips on the CryptoCape from the BBB. We'll accomplish this by <em class="calibre9">jamming</em> the SCL line on the I2C bus.</p><p class="calibre7">One weakness of I2C is that one misaligned device can disrupt the entire bus. On the CryptoCape, every IC is connected to the same I2C bus. We'll exploit this for this project. The ATmega will hold the SCL low until a successful fingerprint is received. This essentially jams the bus since the master, the BBB, can't generate the start condition.</p><p class="calibre7">The software running on the BBB will hang until the ATmega releases the lock. Typically, this is a very undesirable effect. For this project, however, it illustrates how two microprocessors can interact and even interfere with one another. In the following screenshot, you can see the effect of this jamming of Salee Logic Analyzer software. Once the SCL is released, the BBB is finally able to send a start condition.</p><div><img src="img/00015.jpeg" alt="Uploading the biometric detection sketch" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">In the <code class="email">FPS_CryptoCape.ino</code> file, this<a id="id325" class="calibre1"/> is accomplished by setting digital output 2 as an output and then pulling the line low. When a fingerprint is recognized, the pin is configured as an input, which prevents the ATmega from pulling the line either high or low and allows normal I2C operation.</p><p class="calibre7">Add a jumper wire from <em class="calibre9">D2</em> on the ATmega breakout pads to the <em class="calibre9">SCL</em> pad near the TPM on the CryptoCape. This is that one extra wire that will allow the ATmega to lock out the BBB's access to the I2C bus. Once you add that wire, upload the <code class="email">FPS_CryptoCape.cpp.hex</code>, which you can either compile yourself or use the pre-compiled version.

While it does prevent software on the BBB from using the CryptoCape until a valid fingerprint is accepted, the system is easily defeated by pulling (or cutting) the line from D2 to SCL. Without the electrical connection, the ATmega can't interfere with the I2C bus. However, depending on your installation, an attacker may have a difficult time physically accessing the hardware. The process of assessing vulnerabilities and mitigations to those vulnerabilities is known as <a id="id328" class="calibre1"/>
<strong class="calibre8">threat modeling</strong>. In the previous chapter, the Tor design stated that it can't defend against a global passive adversary. In your implementation of our biometric system, maybe access to the jamming line is not a threat because you've placed your BBB in an adamantium box. There is no perfectly secure system so a threat model helps us understand the strengths, weaknesses, and <a id="id329" class="calibre1"/>assumptions of our system.
