<p>Kali is a Debian-based Linux distribution developed for the purpose of security testing. Having hundreds of penetration testing tools preinstalled, Kali is a ready-to-use OS. We can run it off a live CD, USB media, or in a virtual machine.</p>
<p>The latest versions of Kali have gone through some major changes, one of them being, since Kali 2.0, that the entire system has been shifted to a rolling release model. Now we can simply install Kali 2.0 or a higher version on our system and get the latest versions of the tools in it through normal updates. This means we don't have to remove the existing OS and install the latest version of Kali 2.2 to get the latest stuff.</p>
<p>To explore Kali 2.2, download the latest version of it from its official website at <a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">https://www.kali.org/downloads/.</a></p>
<p>We can download the ISO and then burn it to a CD/DVD or create a bootable USB device. We can even download <strong>Kali Linux VMWare</strong>, <strong>VirtualBox</strong> or <strong>ARM</strong> images from the same link.</p>
<p>The latest version of Kali includes major changes in terms of its updated development environment and tools. We will explore these changes to understand what the differences are.</p>
<p>To start using Kali, we can either install it or use it through the live option.</p>
<p>When we boot Kali, we notice that the GRUB screen has changed and made simple to use as shown:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b3582daa-ca21-442a-b0a0-8ab0b57860ba.png" style="width:39.83em;height:26.83em;"/></p>
<p>The desktop environment of Kali has moved to GNOME 3, with a new redesigned user interface. We can see these changes at the login screen here, which has also been redesigned:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7e11bda8-576e-41c6-bb25-49ace10bb5cf.png" style="width:28.33em;height:17.08em;"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The entire desktop along with the panel as well as the <span class="packt_screen">Applications</span> menu has been redesigned/reconstructed:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9ffd78d4-c6bc-41af-a7dd-57ecac7cdc7b.png" style="width:53.50em;height:39.67em;"/></p>
<p>We can also access the tools by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Menu</span> icon, which is at the bottom of the sidebar, as shown. This way we can see all the tools at once:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c22ec97e-6fa0-4578-a853-53f152d8b1f8.png" style="width:50.25em;height:36.58em;"/></p>
<p>Kali includes a built-in screencasting option that is actually a part of GNOME 3. On the top, right click on the <span class="packt_screen">Recorder</span> icon and we get the option to <span class="packt_screen">Start recording</span>. Now you can make videos of whatever you are doing on Kali with a single click:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1a94df18-9c05-4115-89d0-b9ab090096f0.png" style="width:22.17em;height:21.50em;"/></p>
<p>If we wish to access the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> menu of Kali, we will see that it is missing under the <span class="packt_screen">Application</span> menu. To access <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span>, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Power</span> icon on the top right and a menu pops out.</p>
<p>In this menu, we can see the <span class="packt_screen">Setting</span><span class="packt_screen">s</span> icon at the bottom left:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2d828dd8-f419-4921-bcc5-b46865e8f2e5.png" style="width:17.00em;height:22.58em;"/></p>
<p>We can also see an option for VPN in this menu. Using this option, we can configure the VPN settings.</p>
<p>When we click on the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> icon in the previous step, we get our <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> menu as shown here. Now make changes in the system's settings as per the requirements:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/0a93c275-5a2e-452b-8930-16672456fbef.png" style="width:45.75em;height:34.25em;"/></p>
<p>Scroll down and click on <span class="packt_screen">Details</span> to see more information about Kali Linux.</p>
<p>We can see details about the system in the screen shown here. This includes information about the GNOME version:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/efb417ad-53df-46d9-8b12-34ef851e5874.png" style="width:49.25em;height:34.25em;"/></p>
<p>Whenever we wish to update Kali, just click on the <span class="packt_screen">Check for updates</span> button in the <span class="packt_screen">Details</span> window.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>If your system is already up to date, a message will appear as shown here, otherwise the available updates can be downloaded:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6586344c-206a-4217-a46e-2cb8b0e40fbf.png" style="width:53.25em;height:29.08em;"/></p>
<p>When we boot Kali, we will see that the desktop screen has changed. We now have a sidebar on the left side of the screen that helps us to access applications easily.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Application</span> menu on the top left contains all the tools under different categories. The applications can also be accessed by using the <span class="packt_screen">Menu</span> icon on the sidebar at the bottom.</p>
<p>Next we see that Kali includes an inbuilt screen recording tool that can be accessed from the menu on the top right. In the same menu, we now have the option to access the menu for system settings.</p>
<p>Then we can see the option to check for system updates to keep Kali updated.</p>
<p>Kali has the updated tools included and is built to pull updates from Debian to ensure that the system is always up to date, and to also ensure that the security updates are implemented on a regular basis.</p>

<p>As a network administrator, having a firewall and router in place is essential. When we talk about setting up a firewall, we have the option to either simply install a preconfigured firewall from any vendor or set up our own firewall system.</p>
<p>pfSense is one amazing software distribution, if you wish to set up your own firewall from scratch. It is an open source distribution based on FreeBSD and is specially designed to be used as a firewall that can be managed easily through a web interface.</p>

<p>We boot from the pfSense CD/DVD and then choose the option to install the OS on our system.</p>
<p>To install pfSense, we use the option <span class="packt_screen">I</span> during boot and then we use <span class="packt_screen">Quick/Easy Install</span>. After the installation completes, we set up the two interface cards. The first card is configured according to the outside network, using the option <span class="packt_screen">Set interface IP address</span> from the menu. Then we configure the IP address, subnet, and gateway address.</p>
<p>Next, we repeat the same process for the second card, which we configure according to the local network.</p>
<p>Once the configuration is done, we can use the IP address of the second card to access the web interface of pfSense from any browser on the same network system and customize our router/firewall as per our requirements.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Digital Evidence and Forensic Toolkit  (DEFT)</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>While performing computer forensics, it is important that the software being used is able to ensure the integrity of file structures. It should also be able to analyze the system being investigated, without any alteration, deletion, or change of data.</p>
<p>DEFT is designed for forensics and is based on Lubuntu, which is itself based on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>DEFT can be downloaded from this link: <a href="http://www.deftlinux.net/download/"><span class="URLPACKT">http://www.deftlinux.net/download/.</span></a></p>
<p>Once downloaded, we can burn the image file on CD/DVD media or create a live bootable USB media.</p>
<p>To use DEFT, we need to get an overview about what is included in the OS and we will do that next.</p>
<p>Once we boot the DEFT CD/DVD or USB media, we get the boot screen. Firstly, we need to select the language. Once done, we can choose to either run DEFT live or else we can install DEFT on our system.</p>
<p>In our example, we have chosen to boot DEFT live. We should be presented with the DEFT desktop after the boot process completes.</p>
<p>Now let's understand what different tools are available in DEFT.</p>
<p>In the start menu, the first submenu under DEFT, contains a list of various analysis tools:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5b989eb2-7dcc-4b2f-a010-ab2cf6105259.png" style="width:34.92em;height:33.50em;"/></p>
<p>The next submenu shows all the antimalware tools. Then we have the submenu of tools related to data recovery.</p>
<p>The next submenu contains a list of different hashing tools that can used to check and compare hashes of any file.</p>
<p>In the next submenu, we get tools for imaging. These can be used during forensics investigations for creating an image of a system disk that needs to be investigated. With the release of DEFT 7, tools for the analysis of mobile devices have also been added. These can be found under the, <span class="packt_screen">Mobile Forensics </span>submenu.</p>
<p>The next submenu contains the network forensics tools. The next menu, <span class="packt_screen">OSINT,</span> contains the open source intelligence tools.</p>
<p>DEFT also contains tools for password recovery which can be found in the next submenu.</p>
<p>Apart from these categories of tools, DEFT contains a few reporting tools, which can be useful while creating reports. DEFT uses <strong>WINE</strong> for executing Windows tools under Linux and the options for WINE can be found under the main menu.</p>
<p>We either install DEFT or use the live CD option to boot it on our system. Once booted, we go to the start menu and then we move to the DEFT menu. Here we find various tools under different categories. We can use tools for analysis, data recovery, mobile forensics, network forensics, and so on.</p>
<p>WINE is used in DEFT to execute Windows applications.</p>

<p>Linux has many distributions developed mainly for the purpose of penetration testing. Among those, one is the <strong>Network Security Toolkit </strong>(<strong>NST</strong>), which was developed to provide easy access to open source network security applications at one place.</p>
<p>NST is based on Fedora Linux and contains tools for professionals and network administrators.</p>

<p>Using NST for penetration testing becomes easy when we have an idea about how to use the OS and also what tools are included in the OS.</p>
<ol>
<li>To use NST, the first step is to boot the system with NST. We have the option to either boot using the live option, or directly install NST on the system. In our example, we have chosen the live boot option. You can choose any option as per your requirement.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Once booting completes, we get the default desktop of NST as shown here:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/900c5790-0e39-4ab8-b327-1613a4f0c7a8.png" style="width:29.17em;height:19.25em;"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>NST comes with a web user interface, which is a kind of control panel to do anything with NST. However, this can be accessed only if the existing user account has a password set. To set the password, we click on the icon <span class="packt_screen">Set NST System Password</span> which is on the desktop. This will open a terminal window and give the option to create a new password:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/30c98fbc-d886-40e8-8124-48b3dc4dd2a9.png" style="width:47.92em;height:22.67em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<ol start="4">
<li>Once the password has been set, we can access the NST web user interface from any browser of our choice. To access it on the local system we can use this address: <kbd>http://127.0.0.1:9980/nstwui.</kbd></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tails</strong> is a Linux distribution that runs as a live operating system and can be run on any system from a USB stick or a DVD.</p>
<p>It aims to preserve the privacy and anonymity of the user by helping the user use the internet anonymously and avoid restriction almost anywhere the user goes. Tails also helps the user perform activities without leaving any trace unless they ask it to explicitly.</p>

<p>Tails is a complete operating system that can be used as a live OS from a USB stick or a DVD.</p>
<p>To use Tails, we boot our system using the live DVD or USB of Tails and when we boot our system using Tails, we get the following screen:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f8ee8ee9-2602-48e1-af5d-3afd24972a41.png" style="width:35.00em;height:29.00em;"/></p>
<p>Click <span class="packt_screen">Start Tails</span> to start using the Tails operating system. <span>After booting completes, we are presented with the desktop. Clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Applications</span> menu, we can see different categories of tools present, just like any other Debian-based OS. However, there is one category of <span class="packt_screen">Tails</span>  in the menu:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/018129b0-6e76-4d96-b00c-5678799341b4.png" style="width:48.92em;height:29.33em;"/></p>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The Tails submenu contains the tools that help  it maintain privacy and anonymity. <span>Tails contains the <strong>Tor</strong> browser, which helps in maintaining the privacy online. When we click on the Tor browser, it starts running in the background. We get a notification once Tor is ready:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b2f9795c-9f4d-485c-97bf-2b44e5c15ccb.png" style="width:33.00em;height:13.67em;"/></p>
<p>When we use Tails on any system, it does not alter or depend on the operating system currently running on the system. Tails has been configured to not use the hard disk of the system on which it is running, unless the user explicitly wants to save any data on the hard disk. <span>Tails also comes with a set of tools to protect data, using strong encryption. This includes LUKS for encrypting USB sticks or external hard disks. Tails uses HTTPS Everywhere, to encrypt all communications to any major website, automatically.</span></p>
<p>We can install Tails on a USB stick, by using <span class="packt_screen">Tails Installer</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Application</span> menu:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/eafa331d-68df-461a-93f7-122be8a40866.png" style="width:29.25em;height:25.50em;"/></p>
<p>Tails can be used as a live OS and it comes with preinstalled applications that have been configured keeping security in mind. Once the user boots their computer using Tails, they can use any of these tools to maintain privacy and anonymity.</p>

<p>There are many Linux distributions available in the present time, and this includes several niche distributions. <strong>Qubes</strong> is one such Linux distribution which focuses on security. As its tagline says, it is a "<em>reasonably secure operating system</em>."</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>When a user is using any other operating system, if they unknowingly run a malware, which may have come through email attachments, it can affect everything on the system depending on the severity of the malware.</p>
<p>However, Qubes has been built with a different approach called <em>security by compartmentalization.</em> Its uses Qubes (virtual instances) to isolate programs run by the user.</p>

<li>64-bit Intel or AMD processor (x86_64 also known as x64 aka AMD64)</li>
<li>4 GB RAM</li>
<li>32 GB disk space</li>
</ul>
<p>Qubes can also be installed on systems not meeting these recommended configuration, however the performance may be slow.</p>

<p>Qubes OS uses <strong>Xen hypervisor</strong> for creating and isolating the virtual machines. We can work on these virtual machines to access the same application in isolation.</p>
<p>We can use two different instances of the same browser side by side, and they may be running on different security domains. If we visit a website using both the browsers, and are logged into the website on one if them, that login session will not be used by the other browser window, as it is running on a completely different virtual machine.</p>
