    it is based on Debian, while Fedora (or Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux) uses `rpm`
    packages, as it is based on RHEL. There is also openSUSE, which uses `rpm` packages
    too, but it was based on Slackware at its inception. Besides those, two new package
    types have been recently introduced – the snap packages developed by Canonical,

    software for so many types of Linux distributions, each with its own kind of package
    types, can become a serious issue for **independent software vendors** (**ISVs**)

    aiming to reduce the weight of distributing software.

    a new version of our software is available, we need to create at least two types

    Debian/Ubuntu/Mint and other derivatives, and a `.rpm` package for Fedora/RHEL/SUSE

    flatpak repository, and the snap package would be available through the Snap Store,
    the centralized snap repository. Either one is equally suitable for our aim to
    distribute the app for all major Linux distributions with minimal resource consumption

    ecosystem when it comes to packages. However, these two packages have different
    philosophies, even though they want to solve the same problem. Snaps emerged as
    a new type of package that would be available on the IoT and server versions of
    Canonical’s Ubuntu, while flatpaks emerged from the need to have a coherent package
    type for desktop applications in Linux. Thus, flatpaks are not available on server
    or IoT versions of Linux, only for desktop editions. As both packages evolve,
    more and more distributions are starting to provide them by default, with flatpak
    being the winner in terms of the number of distributions that are offering it
    by default. On the other hand, snaps are mostly available by default on official
    Ubuntu versions, starting with version 23.04\. Flatpaks are available by default
    in Fedora, openSUSE, Pop!_OS, Linux Mint, KDE neon, and other distributions.

    Linux is higher than in the case of the same app packaged for Windows or macOS.

    software for Linux, and this will all be for the better for both users and developers
    alike.

    by developers from GNOME and Red Hat, and it is now heavily used in Fedora Silverblue
    in the form of **rpm-ostree**. It is a new upgrade system for Linux that is meant
    to work alongside existing package management systems. It was inspired by Git
    since it operates similarly. Consider it as a version control system at the OS
    level. It uses a content-addressed object store, allows you to share branches,
    and offers transactional upgrades, as well as rollback and snapshot options, for
    the OS.

    GNOME, KDE, and Xfce, and the first two have the largest communities. If you want
    to use the very best and latest of GNOME, for example, you can try distributions
    such as Fedora, openSUSE Tumbleweed with GNOME, or Arch Linux (or Manjaro). If
    you want to use the best of KDE, you can try KDE neon, openSUSE Tumbleweed with
    KDE, or Arch Linux with KDE (or Manjaro). For Xfce, you can try MX Linux (based
    on Debian), which defaults to Xfce, or openSUSE with Xfce. As a rule, the most
    widely used Linux distributions offer variants, also called *flavors* (in the
    case of Ubuntu) or *spins* (in the case of Fedora) with different desktop environments
    available. The RHEL and SUSE commercial versions come with GNOME only by default.
