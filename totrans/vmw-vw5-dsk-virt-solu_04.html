The devices supported by VMware View vary greatly and include thick client, thin client, zero clients, and other devices, for example, the Apple iPad. This chapter will cover the various types of clients as well as the features that they do and do not support so that proper design considerations can be made in an overall solution.<a id="id168" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Something to keep in mind when evaluating client devices for a VMware View solution is that most people associate the quality of their work computer with the size and appearance of their monitor.</p><p>For example, Jenson has a dusty HP workstation under his desktop connected to a 17-inch monitor. If the IT department replaces Jenson's dusty HP workstation with a zero client and 24-inch monitor, he is likely to already have a positive impression. Extend the positive perception by giving Jenson, who previously ran a Windows XP workstation, a Windows 7 vDesktop, and Jenson is likely to rave about his "new computer".</p><p>The device selection is important for the success of a VDI project as it is the gateway for users to connect to their vDesktops.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Thick and thin clients</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Teradici PCoIP powered zero clients and other clients</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Choosing proper devices for your organization</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec01"/>Thick clients</h1></div></div></div><p>A<strong> thick client</strong> is a laptop or desktop running a full version of a workstation operating system, for example, Windows XP. The thick client has a fully usable operating system and uses a natively-installed VMware View Client to connect to the VDI.<a id="id169" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>A few examples of thick clients are as follows:<a id="id170" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Dell OptiPlex workstation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Lenovo laptop</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Apple MacBook Pro</li></ul></div><p>The common advantages of thick clients are as follows:<a id="id171" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">They support Local Mode (Windows-based thick clients only)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Typically, they provide high performance (from a graphics offloading perspective)</li></ul></div><p>The major difference between thick clients and thin clients is that Windows-based thick clients are able to support checked out Local Mode desktops. While Windows-based thin clients have the capability to support checked out Local Mode vDesktops, they are often locked down and don't have enough local storage to house the encrypted vDesktop image. Therefore, if there is a use case in a particular solution for end users in a disconnected state, those end users will typically need to be issued thick clients to meet the requirements of VMware View Local Mode.<a id="id172" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>In addition to supporting Local Mode, thick clients typically have extremely good performance as they are often ordered with more than 2 GB of RAM, a multicore processor and moderate-to-high performing local disk. With some entry-level thin clients, running multimedia applications may cause the thin client's CPU to reach 100 percent as it struggles to handle the multimedia redirection. Multimedia redirection causes the media to be rendered at the end device, placing importance on the end device's horsepower capabilities.</p><p>The drawbacks of thick clients are as follows:<a id="id173" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Another workstation to keep patched, maintained, and in compliance</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Potential of having data at the edge (as the device is still a fully functional desktop by itself)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An additional operating system to license</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A volatile endpoint</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Higher target of theft (again, because the device is a fully functional device by itself)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The users require additional training as they may be confused when they are navigating their vDesktop and when they are actually on the native OS</li></ul></div><p>Oftentimes, during a migration to a virtual desktop solution from an existing physical desktop environment, the organization will be interested-in phasing in thin or zero clients. This approach is common in organizations that have just recently purchased new thick clients (for example, workstations) and/or organizations that are not up for a refresh for several years to come. However, by phasing-in thin or zero clients, the organization will still be forced to manage the underlying OS of the thick client.</p><p>In addition to forcing an organization to manage the underlying OS, the organization may (depending on their particular OS license agreement) be forced to license the OS on the thick client in addition to the OS of the virtual desktop. This could quickly increase the license count needed for an organization and increase the overall capital expenditure of the virtual desktop initiative.<a id="id174" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Finally, a thick client is typically a machine that boots from a writeable partition. This means that the device may come up in a slightly different state on every boot. The consistency of a thin client or a zero client does not come into play, therefore, maintenance tasks such as reimaging thick clients are likely to be incurred and thus increase the operational expenses associated with each thick client.<a id="id175" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec01"/>Repurposing thick clients</h2></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Repurposing</strong> is the process of taking a thick client (for example, Dell OptiPlex workstation with Windows XP installed) and turning it into a purpose-built VMware View endpoint. Repurposing typically involves the following:<a id="id176" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Installing a streamlined operating system (such as Windows XP embedded or a Linux distribution)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Installing little additional applications on the repurposed thick client other than the VMware View Client</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Preventing changes to the thick client's configuration</li></ul></div><p>An alternative to reimaging thick clients with a new, purpose-built image, is to use a bootable solution. For example, by creating a Live CD with a Linux desktop operating system and the necessary components to run the VMware View Client, thick clients can simply be booted off of a CD (read-only). This ensures a uniform experience each and every time a user turns on his/her device. The newly released VMware View Client for Linux makes repurposing even more appealing for many organizations without the capital to invest in PCoIP zero clients, for example.</p><p>Repurposing thick clients is often viewed as a stop gap measure to a zero client implementation as well as a means of prolonging the life of aging desktop hardware.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec02"/>Thin clients</h1></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Thin clients</strong> refer to purpose-built devices that run a streamlined OS (for example,<strong> Microsoft Windows XP Embedded (XPe)</strong>, SUSE Linux) meant to deliver a minimal desktop environment to the end user. From this minimal desktop environment, the end user launches the VMware View Client and is then connected to his/her virtual desktop. Thin clients often have a write-protected or write-filtered system partition.<a id="id177" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>A few examples of thin clients are as follows:<a id="id178" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">ClearCube I8520</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Wyse R50</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Dell Latitude Mobile 13</li></ul></div><p>The common advantages of thin clients are as follows:<a id="id179" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">They provide a consistent desktop environment</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">They allow third-party software (such as a VPN client) to be installed</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">They have a smaller footprint than thick clients</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Typically, they consume less power than thick clients</li></ul></div><p>As thin clients are typically locked-down OSs with a write-filter (not allowing any writes to the system partition, or only allowing writes in specific subdirectories), the end user will have a consistent experience during every boot process. This can help reduce operational expenses associated with patching, maintaining, and reimaging thick clients.</p><p>In addition, thin clients allow the installation of third-party software to create a streamlined OS image specific to an organization's needs.</p><p>Currently, zero clients do not support a<strong> Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong> connection as there is no client built into the PCoIP firmware. However, VMware View 4.6 introduced the ability to use PCoIP through a security server, which is a preferred method of remote connectivity due to a better end user experience over a typical VPN connection.<a id="id180" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>For organizations that want to lockdown the end devices, provide a consistent experience, and require a VPN connection, thin clients are a solid choice for an end device.</p><p>The drawbacks of thin clients are as follows:<a id="id181" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Cost</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Performance</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Potential vendor lock-in for upgrades (for example, Wyse)</li></ul></div><p>While thin clients often have less features and a lower specification in terms of the hardware platform, their cost is typically equal to that of thick clients for most organizations. This is partly due to the high volume orders typically associated with thick client purchases and the healthy discounts that go with such an order. This is also due to the fact that thin clients are still a lower volume business overall and the manufacturing costs are typically higher than that of traditional thick clients.</p><p>Also, as thin clients are often trying to use and deliver the minimum possible for the end user to have a favorable experience (and ultimately connect back to a virtual desktop with sufficient horsepower for a user's needs), the overall experience can suffer if the thin client's processor can't handle multimedia redirection (for example).</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec03"/>Teradici PCoIP-powered zero clients</h1></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Zero clients</strong> refer to a device with an embedded Teradici PCoIP chip that allows the device to immediately boot to the VMware View Client without the need for an underlying OS. Zero clients do not have a writeable system partition, nor a hard disk for that matter. Instead, zero clients boot off of a chipset embedded into the device.<a id="id182" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>This section specifically highlights<strong> Teradici PCoIP-powered</strong> devices as it is the author's opinion that other zero clients on the market that do not adopt the PCoIP model are destined for obsolescence. At the very least, they will likely not have the same levels of adoption within the VMware ecosystem.<a id="id183" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>A few examples of zero clients are as follows:<a id="id184" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Samsung NC240 monitor</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">EVGA PD02</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">ClearCube I9424</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Wyse P20</li></ul></div><p>The common advantages of zero clients are as follows:<a id="id185" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Security</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ease of configuration</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Cost</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Vendor diagnostics for management</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Often a smaller footprint than thin clients</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Often less power consumption than thin clients</li></ul></div><p>Zero clients are the most secure end devices an organization can leverage for their VMware View solution as there is no hard disk inside a zero client. In a zero client-based solution, there is no chance for sensitive data to reside on an end device because the end device is not capable of storing such data.</p><p>Zero clients are often viewed as on a par or easier than thin clients to configure. This is because a zero client has very few settings (IP settings, VMware View Connection Server, and other minor settings) as the goal is to get the end users to their entitled virtual desktop as fast as possible.</p><p>Finally, zero clients are often viewed as not only the most secure but also the most affordable solution. This is because, for organizations looking to replace their desktops, for example, a Samsung NC240 with a keyboard and mouse is often significantly cheaper than a thin client (which still needs a monitor). For organizations looking to leverage existing monitors, a standard zero client (for example, EVGA PD02) may be one of the cheapest options on the market.<a id="id186" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The drawbacks of zero clients are as follows:<a id="id187" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Currently, they do not support VPN inside the client</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">They do not support Local Mode</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Currently, they do not offer Wi-Fi support natively</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">No client side caching</li></ul></div><p>For organizations that need their end devices to establish a VPN connection in order to connect to the VMware View Connection Server environment, a zero client will not suffice. This is because zero clients currently do not have a VPN client embedded into the firmware and have no means of establishing a secure connection to a remote peer.</p><p>It should be noted that a proper VMware View solution leveraging a security server should negate the need of a VPN connection.</p><p>Also, zero clients have no means to support a virtual desktop running natively in Local Mode. There are no mobile-centric (for example, a zero client in a laptop housing) zero client solutions today, so mobile users needing to leverage Local Mode may still be best served by a traditional thick client.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec04"/>Other clients</h1></div></div></div><p>Other clients can include items such as an Apple iPhone, Asus Transformer (Android-based tablet), Apple iPad, or a Dell Streak. The most popular peripherals right now are tablet-based end devices, primarily the Apple iPad and Android-based tablets.<a id="id188" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The drawback of these other clients is that they may not support Local Mode. Also, devices, for example, the Apple iPad do not support Local Mode, meaning that when the end user is out-of-band (for example, on an airplane without Wi-Fi), the user will be unable to access his/her desktop.</p><p>For organizations deploying tablets as the end device, it is strongly encouraged to provide a keyboard solution with the tablets. Today, most of the users are native users of conventional keyboard and mouse solutions. Tablet devices offer a new type of input that many users are still growing accustomed to. While the user experience is often enjoyable, trying to type a long e-mail or perform some of the regular work tasks in certain organizations, may prove tedious.<a id="id189" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The VMware View Client for the iPad, for example, supports Bluetooth keyboards, such as the Zagg Mate (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.zagg.com/accessories/logitech-ipad-2-keyboard-case">http://www.zagg.com/accessories/logitech-ipad-2-keyboard-case</a>).<a id="id190" class="indexterm"/>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec06"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>VMware View is an extremely flexible solution that can support a wide variety of end devices. This helps increase the overall success of a VDI initiative because it allows users to bring the device that works best for them in a given situation or state of connectivity. For example, a user can simply travel with an Apple iPad and use the VMware View Client to connect into their corporate vDesktop to perform light tasks, such as internal browsing, file management, and so on. When the user is back at his/her home office or his/her desk at work, they may have a full-blown desktop with the View Client to work from; allowing faster input, for example.</p><p>From the collective experiences of the authors of this book, PCoIP zero clients are often the best way to move forward for an organization, as it removes an unnecessary variable from the overall VDI solution. PCoIP zero clients are dependable, predictable, affordable, and secure.</p><p>The next chapter discusses how to properly size the VMware View solution, which is important to ensure a positive end user experience, redundancy, and cost effectiveness. Now that the ground work has been laid for VMware View, it is time to jump in and start designing the software and hardware infrastructure.</p></div></body></html>
