    The project has gradually grown and continues to do so, with roughly a thousand
    contributors around the world. Nowadays, Linux is a must, in embedded systems
    as well as on servers. A **kernel** is a central part of an operating system,
    and its development is not straightforward. Linux offers many advantages over
    other operating systems; it is free of charge, well documented with a large community,
    is portable across different platforms, provides access to the source code, and
    has a lot of free open source software.'

    dedicated to ARM processors, especially those that fully support the device tree.
    Why those architectures? Because they are mostly used on desktops and servers
    (for x86), as well as embedded systems (ARM).

    over the past few years, embedded computers have become more powerful, and they
