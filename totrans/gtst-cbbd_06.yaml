    are updated automatically via the new packages; the bootloader and kernel, however,
    are not. This chapter will describe the various bootloaders available as well
    as the various kernels and which one to choose.

    such as an SSD or a hard disk, a USB drive, and a microSD card, to boot from.
    Optionally, a low-capacity microSD card can also be used for this purpose instead.
    I have used a small 128 MB microSD card for this book, but even something on the
    lower side would work. All that needs to fit in the microSD card is the bootloader,
    some configuration files, and a kernel. About 4 MB of space would be required
    for that, though it will be really hard to find a microSD card with that capacity.

- en: The bootloader is the first thing that gets loaded that is actually user modifiable.
    The name of the bootloader that is used by the community and throughout this book
    is **u-boot**. It comes in two separate flavors. First, there is the *lichee*
    variant but it is not actively being developed. The reason why it is still around
    is that it is the only bootloader that currently supports booting of the onboard
    NAND flash. This bootloader is nearly always preinstalled and generally there
    isn't any reason for it to be replaced. More interesting is the *sunxi* variant
    of u-boot, which is being actively developed by the community and which we will
    check out in the following section.

    chip boots for the first time, it cannot access the main system memory, which
    is also known as RAM. There is a little bit of memory, the SRAM, available inside
    the SoC chip. The SRAM, however, is too small to hold the entire u-boot, so u-boot
    is split into two: the **Secondary Program Loader** (**SPL**) and the actual u-boot.
    The SPL is just enough to initialize the memory and load the new, bigger u-boot
    into the memory. These files both need to be written to very specific regions
    so that the SoC understands where to boot from. To make it a little bit easier,
    there is a third file, called `u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin`. This file consists
    of both components combined with the appropriate spacing and is the only thing
    required at this moment.'

    boot from three different locations. SPI-flash, at the time of writing this book,
    is unsupported. However, some early experiments suggest that it should be relatively
    easy. While u-boot could be written onto the NAND flash ROM, the community-developed
    version of u-boot is currently unable to read or write from the NAND flash. The
    only option that remains is the microSD card, which as been used until now and
    will be used again.

    on the SD card. For example, writing the bootloader at the beginning of the SD
    card destroys the partition table. Writing the bootloader a little too far can
    destroy the filesystem on the SD card. In both cases, there will be data loss
    because the bootloader is not in the right position, and thus the SD card is unbootable.

    common for microSD cards to have no partition table. Using the knowledge acquired
    in [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Installing an Operating System"), *Installing
    an Operating System*, at least one partition should be created on the microSD
    card with at least 4 MB of free space. The partition has to be formatted either
    in `fat`, `ext2`, `ext3`, or `ext4`.

    it is safe to remove the used microSD card and insert a different one. Depending
    on which device is being used, make sure you replace `sdb` with `mmcblk0` or whichever
    device node the SD card is assigned to. Nothing to do with bits. Copying certain
    files, however, might be trickier, and might have to be stored elsewhere meanwhile.

    The important parameters are `blocksize` (`bs`) and `seek`, where `blocksize`,
    when multiplied with `seek`, indicates the exact location on the microSD card—in
    this case, at exactly 8 KB. The reason is simple; this is the exact location at
    which the SoC chip will search the SD card for the bootloader, as illustrated

- en: For x86-based systems, there is usually only one kernel; the one supplied by
    the distribution in most cases. This kernel is always based on the kernel from
    [http://www.kernel.org](http://www.kernel.org). This kernel is often called the
    mainline kernel, vanilla kernel or upstream kernel. For Allwinner-based SoC chips,
    there is very limited support in the kernel developed by the community since 2012
    with Version 3.8\. There are older versions of the kernel where all the features
    have been added by Allwinner itself. While these changes are not of the quality
    that the mainline kernel accepts, it is all that there is for now. It, however,
    is near feature-complete and thus often the only option available to date. All
    these various kernels are available in various branches on a Git repository. There
    are nightly precompiled images available just as there were for u-boot, and they
    can be used in this book. Before continuing to download one of these precompiled
    archives, a little needs to be explained about the various versions available.

    of the sun series. Similarly, the **sun5i** is the internal name for the A10S,
    and A13\. A31 and A31S are called **sun6i**. The A20 is called **sun7i,** and
    **sun8i** is the name for the new A23\. The combined name for all these is called
    **sunxi**. For almost all the kernel versions and each of these machine types,
    there is either a Git branch or a nightly pre-compiled binary version.

    to release the GPL licensed code. Once it was liberated by a device maker of Allwinner-based

    then started to form around this source release. It has been obsolete for a long

    The basis for the 3.0 kernel was also initially liberated by a third-party tablet
    manufacturer. The community did start from scratch again and put in some heavy
    work into this kernel's release. Later, Allwinner also released their kernel Version
    3.0, but it had already diverged compared to the community-built kernel. One major
    thing that was done by the community, for example, is the unification of the various
    machine types. Allwinner intended to release the sun4i and sun5i kernels completely
    separated, where the community brought it under a generic sunxi kernel and drivers.
    It has seen many other improvements from what was supplied by Allwinner, but not
    all patches and fixes were immediately put into the 3.0 series. Patches were always
    first put into a so-called stage tree of 3.0, and after a few weeks of testing,
    those patches were merged back into the 3.0 tree. The 3.0 tree is technically
    obsolete as well but does see some active use, as it is still in use by many tablets.

    to it for an extended period. The drivers for sunxi hardware were forwardported
    from 3.0 to 3.4 to have the Allwinner hardware support, on a well-supported kernel
    release. Just as with 3.0, the stage variant of 3.4 holds all the new patches
    and is merged to 3.4, as it is considered stable. The 3.4 series is currently
    being actively developed and recommended for day-to-day use.

    drivers to it. The big difference with 3.4 is that 3.14 was a release of the kernel,
    and there was some actual support for sunxi SoCs. As long as these kernels are
    marked experimental, they should not be used except to experiment with.

    tries to capture all these under-review patches and merges them into the mainline
    following tree. In other words, this tree holds support for most of the hardware
    to this date, but it may very well change as the review process continues. This
    kernel should only be used when working on drivers, doing reviews, or wanting
    to help testing new things. This branch, however, may be removed in future as
