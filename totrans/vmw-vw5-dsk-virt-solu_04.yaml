- en: VMware View is a solution that delivers a desktop experience to end devices,
    through the PCoIP protocol. The devices supported by VMware View vary greatly
    and include thick client, thin client, zero clients, and other devices, for example,
    the Apple iPad. This chapter will cover the various types of clients as well as
    the features that they do and do not support so that proper design considerations
    can be made in an overall solution.

    is that most people associate the quality of their work computer with the size

    a 17-inch monitor. If the IT department replaces Jenson's dusty HP workstation
    with a zero client and 24-inch monitor, he is likely to already have a positive
    impression. Extend the positive perception by giving Jenson, who previously ran
    a Windows XP workstation, a Windows 7 vDesktop, and Jenson is likely to rave about
    his "new computer".

    operating system, for example, Windows XP. The thick client has a fully usable
    operating system and uses a natively-installed VMware View Client to connect to
    the VDI.

- en: The major difference between thick clients and thin clients is that Windows-based
    thick clients are able to support checked out Local Mode desktops. While Windows-based
    thin clients have the capability to support checked out Local Mode vDesktops,
    they are often locked down and don't have enough local storage to house the encrypted
    vDesktop image. Therefore, if there is a use case in a particular solution for
    end users in a disconnected state, those end users will typically need to be issued
    thick clients to meet the requirements of VMware View Local Mode.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to supporting Local Mode, thick clients typically have extremely
    good performance as they are often ordered with more than 2 GB of RAM, a multicore
    processor and moderate-to-high performing local disk. With some entry-level thin
    clients, running multimedia applications may cause the thin client's CPU to reach
    100 percent as it struggles to handle the multimedia redirection. Multimedia redirection
    causes the media to be rendered at the end device, placing importance on the end
    device's horsepower capabilities.

- en: Oftentimes, during a migration to a virtual desktop solution from an existing
    physical desktop environment, the organization will be interested-in phasing in
    thin or zero clients. This approach is common in organizations that have just
    recently purchased new thick clients (for example, workstations) and/or organizations
    that are not up for a refresh for several years to come. However, by phasing-in
    thin or zero clients, the organization will still be forced to manage the underlying
    OS of the thick client.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to forcing an organization to manage the underlying OS, the organization
    may (depending on their particular OS license agreement) be forced to license
    the OS on the thick client in addition to the OS of the virtual desktop. This
    could quickly increase the license count needed for an organization and increase
    the overall capital expenditure of the virtual desktop initiative.

- en: Finally, a thick client is typically a machine that boots from a writeable partition.
    This means that the device may come up in a slightly different state on every
    boot. The consistency of a thin client or a zero client does not come into play,
    therefore, maintenance tasks such as reimaging thick clients are likely to be
    incurred and thus increase the operational expenses associated with each thick
    client.

    to use a bootable solution. For example, by creating a Live CD with a Linux desktop
    operating system and the necessary components to run the VMware View Client, thick
    clients can simply be booted off of a CD (read-only). This ensures a uniform experience
    each and every time a user turns on his/her device. The newly released VMware
    View Client for Linux makes repurposing even more appealing for many organizations
    without the capital to invest in PCoIP zero clients, for example.

    method of remote connectivity due to a better end user experience over a typical
    VPN connection.

    of the hardware platform, their cost is typically equal to that of thick clients
    for most organizations. This is partly due to the high volume orders typically
    associated with thick client purchases and the healthy discounts that go with
    such an order. This is also due to the fact that thin clients are still a lower
    volume business overall and the manufacturing costs are typically higher than
    that of traditional thick clients.

    for the end user to have a favorable experience (and ultimately connect back to
    a virtual desktop with sufficient horsepower for a user's needs), the overall
    experience can suffer if the thin client's processor can't handle multimedia redirection

- en: Zero clients are the most secure end devices an organization can leverage for
    their VMware View solution as there is no hard disk inside a zero client. In a
    zero client-based solution, there is no chance for sensitive data to reside on
    an end device because the end device is not capable of storing such data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Zero clients are often viewed as on a par or easier than thin clients to configure.
    This is because a zero client has very few settings (IP settings, VMware View
    Connection Server, and other minor settings) as the goal is to get the end users
    to their entitled virtual desktop as fast as possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, zero clients are often viewed as not only the most secure but also
    the most affordable solution. This is because, for organizations looking to replace
    their desktops, for example, a Samsung NC240 with a keyboard and mouse is often
    significantly cheaper than a thin client (which still needs a monitor). For organizations
    looking to leverage existing monitors, a standard zero client (for example, EVGA
    PD02) may be one of the cheapest options on the market.

    perform light tasks, such as internal browsing, file management, and so on. When
    the user is back at his/her home office or his/her desk at work, they may have
