    testing. Having hundreds of penetration testing tools preinstalled, Kali is a
    ready-to-use OS. We can run it off a live CD, USB media, or in a virtual machine.

- en: The latest versions of Kali have gone through some major changes, one of them
    being, since Kali 2.0, that the entire system has been shifted to a rolling release
    model. Now we can simply install Kali 2.0 or a higher version on our system and
    get the latest versions of the tools in it through normal updates. This means
    we don't have to remove the existing OS and install the latest version of Kali
    2.2 to get the latest stuff.
