- en: It is that time of the year again when there are a few days to spare, and you
    are anxious to play with one of these new ARM development boards everybody keeps
    talking about. There are, however, a lot of boards available. With so many choices
    available, which board do you pick? Choosing the board to start working with can
    make a difference later on, so this chapter provides an introduction to the various
    boards and states the major differences between them. While the focus of this
    book does indeed lie on the Cubieboard family from Cubietech, it might still be
    prudent to give this chapter some attention for a potential second board. Additionally,
    this book does apply just as easily to the boards mentioned here.

- en: In the last few years, ARM-based **Systems on Chips** (**SoCs**) have become
    immensely popular. Compared to the regular x86 Intel-based or AMD-based CPUs,
    they are much more energy efficient and still perform adequately. They also incorporate
    a lot of peripherals, such as a **Graphics Processor Unit** (**GPU**), a **Video
    Accelerator** (**VPU**), an audio controller, various storage controllers, and
    various buses (I2C and SPI), to name a few things. This immensely reduces the
    required components on a board. With the reduction in the required components,
    there are a few obvious advantages, such as reduction in the cost and, consequentially,
    a much easier design of boards. Thus, many companies with electronic engineers
    are able to design and manufacture these boards cheaply.

    SoCs will be the focus of this book. Due to their low price and decent availability,
    quite a few companies design development boards around these chips and sell them
    at a low cost. Additionally, the A-series is presently the most open source friendly
    series of chips available. There is a fully open source bootloader, and nearly
    all the hardware is supported by open source drivers. Among the A-series of chips,
    there are a few choices. The following is a list of the most common and most interesting
    devices:'

    as it has been around for a long time. It is able to communicate with the outside
    world over I2C, SPI, MMC, NAND, digital and analog video out, analog audio out,
    SPDIF, I2S, Ethernet MAC, USB, SATA, and HDMI. This chip initially targeted everything,
    such as phones, tablets, set-top boxes, and mini PC sticks. For its GPU, it features
    the MALI-400.'

    and left out several parts, such as SATA and analog video in/out, and it has no
    LCD interface. These parts were left out to reduce the cost of the chip, making
    it interesting for cheap TV sticks.'

    for primary use in tablets. It lacked SATA, Ethernet MAC, and also HDMI, which
    reduced the chip''s cost even more.'

    to the A10 with the intend to replace it. As the name hints, the A20 is a dual-core
    variant of the A10\. The ARM cores are slightly different; Cortex-A7 has been
    used in the A10 instead of Cortex-A8 used previously.'

    similar to the A31 in its design. It features a dual-core Cortex-A7 design and
    is intended to replace the A13\. It is mainly intended to be used in tablets.'

    connections that the A10 has. It is, however, not popular within the community
    because it features a PowerVR GPU that, until now, has seen no community support
    at all. Additionally, there are no development boards commonly available for this
    chip.'

    used these chips in their products, such as tablets, set-top boxes, and eventually,
    development boards. Before the availability of development boards, people worked
    on and with tablets and set-top boxes. The most common and popular boards are
    from Cubietech and Olimex, in part because both companies handed out development
    boards to community developers for free.

    boards: the Cubieboard1, the Cubieboard2, and the Cubieboard3—also known as the
    Cubietruck. Interfacing with these boards can be quite tricky as they use 2 mm

    everything that the previous boards offer, along with Gigabit Ethernet, VGA, Bluetooth,
    Wi-Fi, and an optical audio out. This does come at a cost as there are fewer pins
    to keep the size reasonably small. Compared to Raspberry Pi or LIME, it is almost
    double the size.

    it is quite different and does not work when using Raspberry Pi image files. Nevertheless,
    it features composite video out, stereo audio out, HDMI out Gigabit Ethernet,
    two USB ports, one USB OtG port, CSI out and LVDS out, and a handful of pins.

    debugging at a lower level is required. This is also certainly true with development
    boards such as these. An error occurs, and there's no output; what could have
    possibly gone wrong? So spending hours on trial and error can be avoided; the
    old and trusty serial port exists on many types of hardware. With Allwinner's
    SoCs, they are implemented in two ways.

    While both speak the same protocol, they operate at different voltages to do this;
    thus, a level translator is required at the least. Most PCs are without a serial
    port these days anyway and have to rely on a USB to **universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter**

    the least that they should supply when not using anything power hungry, such as
    an HDD or an LCD. If extra peripherals are attached, this requirement also goes
    up. A proper 5-volt, 2-amp power supply will be enough to power a board under
    full load with an LCD attached. Depending on the power requirements of the hard
    drive, even that should be able to work quite nicely. When in doubt, always check
    the power drain or power supply stability to exclude that from causing strange
    issues. Cheaply made power supplies available from various shops are often overrated
    and thus they might not supply the required current; however, they might not supply
    the required current and cause everything to run unstably.
