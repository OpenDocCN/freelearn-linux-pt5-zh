- en: '*VMware View 5 Desktop Virtualization Solutions* is meant as a guide for architects,
    solution providers, consultants, engineers, and anyone planning to design and
    implement a solution based on VMware View 5\. It will refer to real-world scenarios
    as they are likely the best teaching examples. It will explain the settings and
    configurations needed to have a successful solution as well as the reason behind
    the decisions.'

    guides for VMware View published by the great people at VMware. The administration
    and installation guides are used during the installation and implementation of
    the solution. The material in this book should be used during the design phase,
    which is before an implementation is underway.

    during a hardware refresh can incur significant operational costs and reduce productivity.
    This is an opportunistic time to migrate users to a VDI solution; in addition,

    and Mac Books only) and instead allow the end user community to use their preferred
    device that ultimately connects back into a managed VDI. As long as the device
    has a support View Client, it is permitted for use within the organization. This
    is often called, **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**.'

    across many verticals all over the world. It's also likely that many server virtualization
    architects will be asked to include a VDI as part of their overall virtualized
    datacenter solution.
