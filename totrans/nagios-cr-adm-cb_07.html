By way of CGI and PHP scripts, it allows an overview of the general performance of all the hosts and services being monitored. It also provides information about their current states and how checks are performed. This allows considerably more detail than that which is normally contained in e-mailed notifications.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/5566_07_01.jpg" alt="Introduction"/></div><p>In most respects, the Nagios Core web interface (without any addons) is designed for the display of information rather than controlling or configuring the server, but there are some things that can be done from it to actually change the way Nagios Core is running. These include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Disabling or enabling active and passive checks, event handlers, notifications, and flap detection, whether for all hosts and services or specific ones</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Sending custom notifications about a host or service that don't necessarily correspond to an actual state change</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Rescheduling checks, commonly done to prioritize a check when there have been problems that the administrator thinks are now resolved and wishes to recheck</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Acknowledging problems, to allow administrators to suppress further notifications from problems that they're working on fixing</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Scheduling downtime to suppress notifications for a certain time period; this was discussed in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Scheduling downtime for a host or service</em></span> recipe in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Working with Checks and States">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Checks and States</em></span></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Leaving comments on hosts and services for the information of any other administrator who inspects them; many of the other actions in this list will do this implicitly</li></ul></div><p>We won't offer a comprehensive survey of the web interface here, as much of its use is explained in other chapters, or otherwise reasonably self-explanatory. Instead, we'll explore a few runtime behavior changes that we can arrange through the web interface listed in the preceding section, and on using and interpreting the reports available under the <span class="strong"><strong>Reports</strong></span> heading of the left navigation menu.</p><p>Another important and extremely useful part of the web interface, the <span class="strong"><strong>Network Status Map</strong></span>, is discussed in several recipes in <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Managing Network Layout">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Managing Network Layout</em></span>.

It's also a good place to visit to adjust monitoring features. For example, if a very large segment of your network is going to be down and it's not practical to schedule downtime for all of the affected hosts, then you could simply suppress notifications completely for a while in order to fix the problem with no distractions.</p><p>Note that the screen includes an overall assessment of the monitoring performance of the server in the top-right corner; this can be a useful first place to look if you suspect that the monitoring server is struggling to keep up with its tasks, or want to get some idea of how many checks it's making.</p><p>Beneath that is a simple bar graph showing the general state of the network. It will change its color depending on the severity of the problems; in the preceding screenshot, there are serious problems with some of the hosts and services on this network, and as a result the bar is short and red.</p></div><div class="section" title="There's more..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec233"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p>If you find the Tactical Overview useful, it may be a good idea to make it the home page for the web interface, rather than the default page which mostly just shows the Nagios Core branding, version, and some links. We can arrange this by changing the value of <code class="literal">$corewindow</code> in <code class="literal">/usr/local/nagios/share/index.php</code> from <code class="literal">main.php</code> to <code class="literal">cgi-bin/tac.cgi</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

</pre></div><p>With this done, when we visit the <code class="literal">/nagios/</code> URL on the monitoring host, the <span class="strong"><strong>Tactical Overview</strong></span> should come up immediately. This can be <a id="id363" class="indexterm"/>done with any of the pages in the menu. The <span class="strong"><strong>Services</strong></span> item is another good choice for an alternative homepage.</p></div><div class="section" title="See also"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec234"/>See also</h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <span class="emphasis"><em>Viewing configuration in the web interface</em></span> recipe in this chapter</li></ul></div></div></div>

<span class="strong"><strong>Reports</strong></span> section of the sidebar:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/5566_07_16.jpg" alt="Viewing and interpreting notification history"/></div><p>It's important to distinguish between alerts and notifications in this section. An <span class="strong"><strong>alert</strong></span> is generated in response to an event such as a host or service changing state. A <span class="strong"><strong>notification</strong></span>, in turn, may or may not be generated as a response to that alert, and be sent to the appropriate contacts. <code class="literal">SOFT</code> state changes constitute alerts; only <code class="literal">HARD</code> state changes generally make notifications.</p><p>It's likely that a production monitoring server will not be <a id="id397" class="indexterm"/>sending notifications for every alert, particularly if you're making good use of the <code class="literal">max_check_attempts</code>, scheduled downtime, and problem acknowledgement features.

The resulting screen should show you the day's notifications as read from the current log file.<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/5566_07_17.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></li><li class="listitem">Note that if you're using the <span class="strong"><strong>log rotation</strong></span> feature of Nagios Core, configured with the <code class="literal">log_rotation_method</code> directive, then you can use the arrows above the table to navigate to the previous period's monitoring (generally 24 hours worth). Additionally, note that the information includes the following:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Links to the hosts and services that generate them</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The contacts to which they were sent</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The notification commands that were run</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The output of the commands that prompted the alert and notification</li></ul></div><p>Also note that you're able to filter for any particular kind of notification, and change the sorting order, <a id="id398" class="indexterm"/>using the form in the top-right corner:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/5566_07_18.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></li><li class="listitem">Next, move to the <span class="strong"><strong>Alerts</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Alerts | History report</strong></span>. Rather than a tabular format, this shows you all of the alerts generated by hosts and services as a list, showing red exclamation icons for <code class="literal">CRITICAL</code> or <code class="literal">DOWN</code> states, green icons for <code class="literal">OK</code> states, and others. The list is broken into intervals of one hour:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/5566_07_19.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div><p>Note that these alerts also include the server being started or shut down. Also note that you're again able to filter for specific alert types with the form in the top-right corner.</p></li><li class="listitem">The other two items in the <span class="strong"><strong>Alerts</strong></span> menu allow generating complex reports with many criteria.

Note that the data presented in these reports is for alerts and notifications, not the actual states of the services over time. To get useful statistics such as the percentage of uptime, you'll want to generate an availability report, as discussed in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Viewing and interpreting availability reports</em></span> recipe in this chapter.</p><p>The same notifications data can also be translated into a MySQL database format via the NDOUtils extension, so that reading the alerts and notifications data programmatically to generate custom reports is possible.

The Quick Start configuration grants all the necessary privileges to the <code class="literal">nagiosadmin</code> user when authenticated via <code class="literal">HTTP</code>.</p><p>If you find that you don't have this privilege, check the <code class="literal">authorized_for_all_service_commands</code> and <code class="literal">authorized_for_all_host_commands</code> directives in <code class="literal">/usr/local/nagios/etc/cgi.cfg</code>, and include your username in both; for example, for the user <code class="literal">tom</code>, the directives might look like the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">authorized_for_all_service_commands=nagiosadmin,tom

In this example, I'm acknowledging a problem with the <span class="strong"><strong>APT</strong></span> service on my machine <span class="strong"><strong>athens</strong></span>; Nagios Core is reporting upgrades available, but they're not critical and I can't run them right now. Hence I'm going to acknowledge them, so that other administrators know I've got a plan for the problem:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/5566_07_36.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Acknowledge this service problem</strong></span> <a id="id418" class="indexterm"/>link under the <span class="strong"><strong>Service Commands</strong></span> menu:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/5566_07_37.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></li><li class="listitem">Complete the resulting form and include the following details:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Host Name</strong></span>: This is the host name for the host or service having the problem.

It may take a little while for the command to be processed. You will <a id="id424" class="indexterm"/>find that there is an acknowledgement icon added to the host or service's link in its menu, and that a comment has been added:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/5566_07_39.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div><p>Your contacts may also receive an <span class="strong"><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</strong></span> notification:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/5566_07_40.jpg" alt="How to do it..."/></div></div><div class="section" title="How it works..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec267"/>How it works...</h2></div></div></div><p>Like most changes issued from the Nagios Core web interface, acknowledging a host or service is a command issued for processing by the server, along with its primary task of executing plugins and recording states. This is why it can sometimes take a few seconds to apply even on an idle server. This is all written to the command file, which is by default stored at <code class="literal">/usr/local/nagios/var/rw/nagios.cmd</code>. The Nagios Core system regularly reads this file, provided external command processing is enabled in <code class="literal">/usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg</code>.</p><p>When the command is executed and the <span class="strong"><strong>Sticky Acknowledgement</strong></span> optio<a id="id425" class="indexterm"/>n is selected, the effect is that the filters normally applied by Nagios Core will notice that the host or service has had its problems acknowledged before dispatching a notification, and will therefore prevent the notification from being sent.</p><p>When the host recovers (a <code class="literal">RECOVERY</code> event), a notification to that <a id="id426" class="indexterm"/>effect will be sent, and the acknowledgement will be removed as it's no longer needed. Future problems with the host or service, even if they're exactly the same problem, will need to be themselves acknowledged.</p></div><div class="section" title="There's more..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec268"/>There's more...</h2></div></div></div><p>Acknowledging host and service problems is a really good habit to get into for administrators, particularly if working in a team, as it may prevent a lot of confusion or duplication of work. It's therefore helpful in the same way comments are, in keeping your team informed about what's going on with the network.</p><p>The distinction between scheduled downtime and acknowledgements is important. <span class="strong"><strong>Downtime</strong></span> is intended to be for <a id="id427" class="indexterm"/>planned outages to a host or service; an <span class="strong"><strong>acknowledgement</strong></span> is intended as a means of notification <a id="id428" class="indexterm"/>that an unanticipated problem has occurred, and is being worked on.</p><p>If we're getting nagged repeatedly by notifications for problems that we already know about, as well as using acknowledgements, then it may be appropriate to review the <code class="literal">notification_interval</code> directive for the applicable hosts or services, to limit the frequency with which notifications are sent. For example, to only send repeat notifications every four hours, we could write the following code snippet:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">define host {
    ...
    notification_interval  240
}</pre></div><p>For low-priority hosts, for example, it's perhaps not necessary to <a id="id429" class="indexterm"/>send notifications every 10 minutes!</p><p>Do not confuse this directive with <code class="literal">notification_period</code>, which is used to define the times during which notifications may be sent, another directive that may require review:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">define host {
    ...
    notification_period  24x7
}</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="See also"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec269"/>See also</h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <span class="emphasis"><em>Adding comments on hosts or services in the web interface</em></span> recipe in this chapter</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <span class="emphasis"><em>Scheduling downtime for a host or service</em></span> recipe in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Working with Checks and States">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Checks and States</em></span></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
