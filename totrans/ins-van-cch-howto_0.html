<strong>Varnish Cache</strong> is an HTTP accelerator that stands between your customers and your application servers, acting as a front-end caching solution to your website. Varnish Cache is not a complete solution and will not serve your application content on its own; instead, it will proxy customers' requests to your web server and store their responses for later usage, avoiding an unnecessary (duplicated) workload.</p><p>Putting your website behind a Varnish Cache is quick and easy. In this book, you will learn how to make the most out of your infrastructure with minimal effort.</p><p>This book is the result of a year of collected information about scalability issues and caching in general, which led to the deployment of Varnish Cache on one of the major e-commerce/marketplace in Latin America.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<em>Installing Varnish Cache (Must know)</em>, introduces you to how to install Varnish Cache using its own official repository and make sure everything is set before we start configuring our Varnish daemon.</p><p>
<em>Varnish Cache server daemon options (Must know)</em>, explains all the daemon options which make your Varnish Cache server act as expected, and adjust memory and CPU usage.</p><p>
<em>Connecting to backend servers (Should know)</em>, defines from which backend servers Varnish will fetch the data and also create mechanisms to make sure that Varnish does not proxy a request to any offline backend.</p><p>
<em>Load balance requests (Should know)</em>, explores all the possibilities of load balancing requests through application servers and creating a dedicated pool of servers to critical parts of your application system.</p><p>
<em>The Varnish Configuration Language (Should know)</em>, will get you started on writing VCL code to manage all your caching policies and manipulate requests and responses.</p><p>
<em>Handling HTTP request vcl_recv (Should know)</em>, explains how to choose backend servers according to what was requested by the client, block restricted content, and avoid cache lookup when it should not be performed.</p><p>
<em>Handling HTTP request vcl_hash (Should know)</em>, explains how Varnish generates the hash used to store the objects in memory and how to customize it to save memory space.</p><p>
<em>Handling HTTP request vcl_pipe and vcl_pass (Should know)</em>, introduces how to handle requests that should not be cached, making the data flow directly to the client.</p><p>
<em>Handling HTTP response vcl_fetch (Should know)</em>, provides the opportunity to rewrite portions of the originated response to suit your needs and stitch ESI parts.</p><p>
<em>Handling HTTP response vcl_deliver (Should know)</em>, explains how to clean up extra headers for server obfuscation and add debug headers to responses.</p><p>
<em>Handling HTTP response vcl_error (Should know)</em>, introduces how to deliver maintenance pages during scheduled or unexpected downtime or redirect users.</p><p>
<em>Caching static content (Should know)</em>, explains how to identify portions of your website that can take advantage of a cache server and how to cache them.</p><p>
<em>Cookies, sessions, and authorization (Become an expert)</em>, explains how to identify unique users and parts of the website that should never be cached.</p><p>
<em>HTTP cache headers (Should know)</em>, discloses what headers are important to a cache server and how to deal with their absence.</p><p>
<em>Invalidating cached content (Should know)</em>,<em> </em>explains how to invalidate content that should no longer be delivered and how to avoid it.</p><p>
<em>Compressing the response (Become an expert)</em>, explains how to save bandwidth and improve the overall speed by compressing data.</p><p>
<em>Monitoring hit ratio (Become an expert)</em>, discloses how well your cache is performing and how Varnish is connecting to your backend servers.</p></div></div>
