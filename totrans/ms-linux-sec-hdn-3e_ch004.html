<p>Managing users is one of the more challenging aspects of IT administration. You need to make sure that users can always access their stuff and that they can perform the required tasks to do their jobs. You also need to ensure that users' stuff is always secure from unauthorized users. In this chapter, we'll look at how to lock down user accounts and user credentials to protect them from attackers and snoopers. We'll wrap up by taking a brief look at a few centralized user management systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Locking down users' home directories</li>
<li>Enforcing strong password criteria</li>
<li>Setting and enforcing password and account expiration</li>
<li>Preventing brute-force password attacks</li>
<li>Locking user accounts</li>
<li>Setting up security banners</li>
<li>Detecting compromised passwords</li>
<li>Understanding central user management systems</li>
</ul>


<h2 data-number="4.2">Locking down users' home directories the Red Hat way</h2>
<p>This is another area where different Linux distro families do business differently from each other. As we shall see, each distro family comes with different default security settings for users’ home directories. A security administrator who oversees a mixed environment of different Linux distros will need to take this into account.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and all of its offspring, such as CentOS and AlmaLinux, have had better out-of-the-box security than any other family of Linux distros. This makes it quicker and easier to harden Red Hat-type systems because much of the work has already been done. One thing that's already been done for us is locking down users' home directories:</p>
<div><pre><code> [donnie@localhost home]$ sudo useradd charlie
 [sudo] password for donnie:
 [donnie@localhost home]$
 [donnie@localhost home]$ ls -l
 total 0
 drwx------. 2 charlie charlie 59 Oct 1 15:25 charlie
 drwx------. 2 donnie donnie 79 Sep 27 00:24 donnie
 drwx------. 2 frank frank 59 Oct 1 15:25 frank
 [donnie@localhost home]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>By default, the <code>useradd</code> utility on Red Hat-type systems creates user home directories with a permissions setting of <code>700</code>. This means that only the user who owns the home directory can access it. All other normal users are locked out. We can see why by looking at the <code>/etc/login.defs</code> file. On your CentOS 7 VM, scroll down toward the bottom of the file, and you'll see this:</p>
<div><pre><code>CREATE_HOME yes
UMASK 077</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In the <code>login.defs</code> file of a RHEL 8 or RHEL 9-type distro, such as AlmaLinux, you’ll see that the <code>UMASK</code> is set for wide-open permissions, which seems a bit strange. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code>UMASK           022</code></pre>
</div>
<p>But, a few lines below that, you’ll see a brand-new directive that we never had before, which looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>HOME_MODE       0700</code></pre>
</div>
<p>So, even though the <code>UMASK</code> is wide-open, new user home directories still get properly locked-down.</p>
<p>The <code>login.defs</code> file is one of two files where default settings for <code>useradd</code> are configured. Either the <code>UMASK</code> line or the <code>HOME_MODE</code> line is what determines the permissions values on home directories as they get created. Red Hat-type distros have it configured with the <code>077</code> value, which removes all permissions from the group and others. Either the <code>HOME_MODE</code> line or the <code>UMASK</code> line is in the <code>login.defs</code> file for all Linux distros, but until recently, Red Hat-type distros have been the only ones that have had them set to such a restrictive value by default. Most non-Red Hat distros usually have a <code>UMASK</code> value of <code>022</code>, which creates home directories with a permissions value of <code>755</code>. This allows everybody to enter everybody else's home directories and access each others' files.</p>


<h2 data-number="4.3">Locking down users' home directories the Debian/Ubuntu way</h2>
<p>Debian and its offspring, such as Ubuntu, have two user creation utilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>useradd</code></li>
<li><code>adduser</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at both of them.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.3.1">useradd on Debian/Ubuntu</h3>
<p>The <code>useradd</code> utility is there, but Debian and Ubuntu don't come with handy preconfigured defaults as the Red Hat-type distros do. If you were to just do <code>sudo useradd frank</code> on a Debian/Ubuntu machine, Frank would have no home directory and would be assigned the wrong default shell. So, to create a user account with <code>useradd</code> on a Debian or Ubuntu system, the command would look something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo useradd -m -d /home/frank -s /bin/bash frank</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Here’s the breakdown of what all this means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>-m</strong> creates the home directory.</li>
<li><strong>-d</strong> specifies the home directory.</li>
<li><strong>-s</strong> specifies Frank's default shell. (Without the <code>-s</code>, Debian/Ubuntu would assign to Frank the <code>/bin/sh </code>shell.)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you look at the home directories on either a Debian or an Ubuntu 20.04 machine, you'll see that they're wide open, with execute and read privileges for everybody:</p>
<div><pre><code> donnie@packt:/home$ ls -l
 total 8
 drwxr-xr-x 3 donnie donnie 4096 Oct 2 00:23 donnie
 drwxr-xr-x 2 frank frank 4096 Oct 1 23:58 frank
 donnie@packt:/home$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see, Frank and I can get into each other's stuff. (And no, I don't want Frank getting into my stuff.) Each user could change the permissions on his or her own directory, but how many of your users would know how to do that? So, let's fix that ourselves:</p>
<div><pre><code> cd /home
 sudo chmod 700 *</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Let's see what we have now:</p>
<div><pre><code> donnie@packt:/home$ ls -l
 total 8
 drwx------ 3 donnie donnie 4096 Oct 2 00:23 donnie
 drwx------ 2 frank frank 4096 Oct 1 23:58 frank
 donnie@packt:/home$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>That looks much better.</p>
<p>To change the default permissions setting for home directories, open <code>/etc/login.defs</code> for editing. Look for this line:</p>
<div><pre><code>UMASK 022</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Change it to this:</p>
<div><pre><code>UMASK 077</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now, new users' home directories will get locked down on creation, just as they do with Red Hat and its offspring.</p>
<p>On Ubuntu 22.04, things are different. Ubuntu developers have finally realized that users’ home directories should be locked down by default. So, the <code>HOME_MODE</code> setting in an Ubuntu 22.04 <code>login.defs</code> file now looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>HOME_MODE       0750</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This includes access permissions for a user’s own personal group, but that’s okay. It still effectively means that only the respective owners of the various home directories can get into them.</p>


<h3 data-number="4.3.2">adduser on Debian/Ubuntu</h3>
<p>The <code>adduser</code> utility is an interactive way to create user accounts and passwords with a single command, which is unique to the Debian family of Linux distros. Most of the default settings that are missing from the Debian implementation of <code>useradd</code> are already set for <code>adduser</code>. On Debian and Ubuntu 20.04, it creates user home directories with the wide-open <code>755</code> permissions value. Fortunately, that's easy to change. (We'll see how in just a bit.) On Ubuntu 22.04, it creates properly locked-down home directories with the restrictive <code>750</code> permissions value. You’ll see that setting in the <code>/etc/adduser.conf</code> file, in the vicinity of line 56:</p>
<div><pre><code>DIR_MODE=750</code></pre>
</div>
<p>As I mentioned before, that will be set to a <code>755</code> value in Ubuntu 20.04. Just change that value to <code>750</code> to lock down the new home directories.</p>
<p>Although <code>adduser</code> is handy for just casual creation of user accounts, it doesn't offer the flexibility of <code>useradd</code> and it isn't suitable for use in shell scripting. One thing that <code>adduser</code> can do that <code>useradd</code> can’t is to automatically encrypt a user's home directory as you create the account. To make it work, you'll first have to install the <code>ecryptfs-utils</code> package. So, to create an account with an encrypted home directory for Cleopatra, you do the following:</p>
<div><pre><code>donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$ sudo apt install ecryptfs-utils
donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$ sudo adduser --encrypt-home cleopatra
 [sudo] password for donnie:
 Adding user `cleopatra&#39; ...
 Adding new group `cleopatra&#39; (1004) ...
 Adding new user `cleopatra&#39; (1004) with group `cleopatra&#39; ...

 ************************************************************************

 THIS WILL BE REQUIRED IF YOU NEED TO RECOVER YOUR DATA AT A LATER TIME.
 ********************************************************************
Done configuring.

  Work Phone []: 555-5556
  Home Phone []: 555-5555
  Other []:
 Is the information correct? [Y/n] Y
 donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$
The first time that Cleopatra logs in, she&#39;ll need to run the ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase command that&#39;s mentioned in the preceding output. She&#39;ll then want to write her passphrase down and store it in a safe place:
 cleopatra@ubuntu-steemnode:~$ ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase
 Passphrase:
 d2a6cf0c3e7e46fd856286c74ab7a412
 cleopatra@ubuntu-steemnode:~$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>We'll look at the whole encryption thing in more detail when we get to the encryption chapter.</p>

<h4 data-number="4.3.2.1">Hands-on lab for creating an encrypted home directory with adduser</h4>
<p>For this lab, we'll be working with the <code>adduser</code> utility on an Ubuntu 22.04 VM.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the <code>ecryptfs-utils</code> package:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo apt install ecryptfs-utils</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Create a user account with an encrypted home directory for Cleopatra and then view the results:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo adduser --encrypt-home cleopatra
ls -l /home</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Log in as Cleopatra and run the <code>ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase</code> command:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>su - cleopatra
ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase
exit</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note that some of the information that <code>adduser</code> asks for is optional, and you can just hit the <em>Enter</em> key for those items.</p>




<h2 data-number="4.4">Enforcing strong password criteria</h2>
<p>You wouldn't think that a benign-sounding topic such as strong password criteria would be so controversial, but it is. The conventional wisdom that you've undoubtedly heard for your entire computer career says:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make passwords of a certain minimum length.</li>
<li>Make passwords that consist of a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>
<li>Ensure that passwords don't contain any words that are found in the dictionary or that are based on the users' own personal data.</li>
<li>Force users to change their passwords on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>But, using your favorite search engine, you'll see that different experts disagree on the details of these criteria. For example, you'll see disagreements about whether passwords should be changed every 30, 60, or 90 days, disagreements about whether all four types of characters need to be in a password, and even disagreements on what the minimum length of a password should be.</p>
<p>The most interesting controversy of all comes from—of all places—the guy who invented the preceding criteria to begin with. He now says that it's all bunk and regrets having come up with it. He now says that we should be using passphrases that are long, yet easy to remember. He also says that they should be changed only if they've been breached.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bill Burr, the former National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) engineer who created the strong password criteria that I outlined earlier, shares his thoughts about why he now disavows his own work. Refer to <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/355496/you-might-not-need-complex-alphanumeric-passwords-after-all.">https://www.pcmag.com/news/355496/you-might-not-need-complex-alphanumeric-passwords-after-all.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, since the original edition of this book was published, NIST has come to agree with Bill Burr. They have now changed their password implementation criteria to match Mr. Burr's recommendations. You can read about that at</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.riskcontrolstrategies.com/2018/01/08/new-nist-guidelines-wrong/">https://www.riskcontrolstrategies.com/2018/01/08/new-nist-guidelines-wrong/</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>However, having said all that, there is the reality that many organizations are still wedded to the idea of using complex passwords that regularly expire, and you'll have to abide by their rules if you can't convince them otherwise. And besides, if you are using traditional passwords, you do want them to be strong enough to resist any sort of password attack. So now, we'll take a look at the mechanics of enforcing strong password criteria on a Linux system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have to confess that I had never before thought to try creating a passphrase to use in place of a password on a Linux system. So, I just now tried it on my CentOS virtual machine to see if it would work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I created an account for Maggie, my black-and-white tuxedo kitty. For her password, I entered the passphrase <code>I like other kitty cats</code>. You may think, "Oh, that's terrible. This doesn't meet any complexity criteria<em>,</em> and it uses dictionary words. How is that secure?" But the fact that it's a phrase with distinct words separated by blank spaces does make it secure and very difficult to brute-force.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, in real life, I would never create a passphrase that expresses my love for cats because it's not hard to find out that I really do love cats. Rather, I would choose a passphrase about some more obscure part of my life that nobody but me knows about. In any case, there are two advantages of passphrases over passwords. They're more difficult to crack than traditional passwords, yet they're easier for users to remember. For extra security though, don't create passphrases about a fact of your life that everybody knows about.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3 data-number="4.4.1">Installing and configuring pwquality</h3>
<p>We'll be using the <code>pwquality</code> module for the <strong>Pluggable Authentication Module</strong> (<strong>PAM</strong>). This is a newer technology that has replaced the old <code>cracklib</code> module. On any Red Hat 7 or newer type of system, and on SUSE and OpenSUSE, <code>pwquality</code> is installed by default, even if you do a minimal installation. If you <code>cd</code> into the <code>/etc/pam.d/</code> directory, you can do a <code>grep</code> operation to see that the PAM configuration files are already set up. <code>retry=3</code> means that a user will only have three tries to get the password right when logging in to the system:</p>
<div><pre><code>[donnie@localhost pam.d]$ grep &#39;pwquality&#39; *
 password-auth:password requisite pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass
 local_users_only retry=3 authtok_type=
 password-auth-ac:password requisite pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass
 local_users_only retry=3 authtok_type=
 system-auth:password requisite pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass
 local_users_only retry=3 authtok_type=
 system-auth-ac:password requisite pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass
 local_users_only retry=3 authtok_type=
 [donnie@localhost pam.d]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>On Debian and Ubuntu, you’ll need to install <code>pwquality</code> yourself, like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo apt install libpam-pwquality</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The rest of the procedure is the same for all of our operating systems and consists of just editing the <code>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</code> file. When you open this file in your text editor, you'll see that everything is commented out, which means that no password complexity criteria are in effect. You'll also see that it's very well documented because every setting has its own explanatory comment.</p>
<p>You can set password complexity criteria however you want just by uncommenting the appropriate lines and setting the appropriate values. Let's take a look at just one setting:</p>
<div><pre><code># Minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if 
# credits are not disabled which is the default). (See pam_cracklib manual.) 
# Cannot be set to lower value than 6. 
# minlen = 8 </code></pre>
</div>
<p>The minimum length setting works on a credit system. This means that for every different type of character class in the password, the minimum required password length will be reduced by one character. For example, let's set <code>minlen</code> to a value of <code>19</code> and try to assign Katelyn the password <code>turkeylips</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>minlen = 19
[donnie@localhost ~]$ sudo passwd katelyn
 Changing password for user katelyn.
 New password:
 BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 18 characters
 Retype new password:
 [donnie@localhost ~]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Because the lowercase characters in <code>turkeylips</code> count as credit for one type of character class, we're only required to have 18 characters instead of 19. If we try this again with <code>TurkeyLips</code>, we'll get:</p>
<div><pre><code>[donnie@localhost ~]$ sudo passwd katelyn
 Changing password for user katelyn.
 New password:
 BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 17 characters
 Retype new password:
 [donnie@localhost ~]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This time, the uppercase <code>T</code> and uppercase <code>L</code> count as a second character class, so we only need to have 17 characters in the password.</p>
<p>Just below the <code>minlen</code> line, you'll see the credit lines. Let's say that you don't want lowercase letters to count toward your credits. You would find this line:</p>
<div><pre><code># lcredit = 1 </code></pre>
</div>
<p>Uncomment it, and change the <code>1</code> to a <code>0</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>lcredit = 0</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Then, try assigning Katelyn <code>turkeylips</code> as a password:</p>
<div><pre><code>[donnie@localhost ~]$ sudo passwd katelyn
 Changing password for user katelyn.
 New password:
 BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 19 characters
 Retype new password:
 [donnie@localhost ~]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This time, the <code>pwquality</code> really does want 19 characters. If we set a credit value to something higher than <code>1</code>, we would get credit for multiple characters of the same class type up to that value.</p>
<p>We can also set the credit values to negative numbers in order to require a certain number of characters types in a password. For example, we could have this:</p>
<div><pre><code>dcredit = -3</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This would require at least three digits in a password. However, it's a really bad idea to use this feature, because someone who's doing a password attack would soon find the patterns that you require, which would help the attacker to more precisely direct the attack. If you need to require that a password has multiple character types, it would be better to use the <code>minclass</code> parameter:</p>
<div><pre><code># minclass = 3</code></pre>
</div>
<p>It's already set to a value of <code>3</code>, which would require characters from three different classes. To use this value, all you have to do is to remove the comment symbol.</p>
<p>The rest of the parameters in <code>pwquality.conf</code> work pretty much the same way, and each one has a well-written comment to explain what it does.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you use your <code>sudo</code> privilege to set someone else's password, the system will complain if you create a password that doesn't meet complexity criteria, but it will let you do it. If a normal user were to try to change his or her own password without <code>sudo</code> privileges, the system would not allow a password that doesn't meet complexity criteria.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4 data-number="4.4.1.1">Hands-on lab for setting password complexity criteria</h4>
<p>For this lab, you can use either a CentOS, AlmaLinux, or Ubuntu virtual machine, as desired. The only difference is that you won't perform Step 1 for either CentOS or AlmaLinux.</p>
<ol>
<li>For Ubuntu only, install the <code>libpam-pwquality</code> package:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo apt install libpam-pwquality</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Open the <code>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</code> file in your preferred text editor. Remove the comment symbol from in front of the <code>minlen</code> line and change the value to <code>19</code>. It should now look like this:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code> minlen = 19</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Save the file and exit the editor.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a user account for Goldie and attempt to assign her the passwords <code>turkeylips</code>, <code>TurkeyLips</code>, and <code>Turkey93Lips</code>. Note the change in each warning message.</li>
<li>In the <code>pwquality.conf</code> file, comment out the <code>minlen</code> line. Uncomment the <code>minclass</code> line and the <code>maxclassrepeat</code> line. Change the <code>maxclassrepeat</code> value to <code>5</code>. The lines should now look like this:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>minclass = 3 
maxclassrepeat = 5 </code></pre>
</div>
<p>Save the file and exit the text editor.</p>
<ol>
<li>Try assigning various passwords that don't meet the complexity criteria that you've set to Goldie's account and view the results.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In the <code>/etc/login.defs</code> file on your CentOS 7 machine, you'll see the line <code>PASS_MIN_LEN 5</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Supposedly, this is to set the minimum password length, but in reality, <code>pwquality</code> overrides it. So, you could set this value to anything at all, and it would have no effect. (Note that the <code>PASS_MIN_LEN</code> parameter is no longer supported on RHEL 8/9-type distros.)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>




<h2 data-number="4.5">Setting and enforcing password and account expiration</h2>
<p>Something you never want is to have unused user accounts remain active. There have been incidents where an administrator set up user accounts for temporary usage, such as for a conference, and then just forgot about them after the accounts were no longer needed.</p>
<p>Another example would be if your company were to hire contract workers whose contract expires on a specific date. Allowing those accounts to remain active and accessible after the temporary employees leave the company would be a huge security problem. In cases like these, you want a way to ensure that temporary user accounts aren't forgotten about when they're no longer needed. If your employer subscribes to the conventional wisdom that users should change their passwords on a regular basis, then you'll also want to ensure that it gets done.</p>
<p>Password expiration data and account expiration data are two different things. They can be set either separately or together. When someone's password expires, he or she can change it, and everything will be all good. If somebody's account expires, only someone with the proper admin privileges can unlock it.</p>
<p>To get started, take a look at the expiry data for your own account. Note that you won't need <code>sudo</code> privileges to look at your own data, but you will still need to specify your own username:</p>
<div><pre><code>donnie@packt:~$ chage -l donnie
 [sudo] password for donnie:
 Last password change : Oct 03, 2017
 Password expires : never
 Password inactive : never
 Account expires : never
 Minimum number of days between password change : 0
 Maximum number of days between password change : 99999
 Number of days of warning before password expires : 7
 donnie@packt:~$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You can see here that no expiration data have been set. Everything here is set according to the out-of-the-box system default values. Other than the obvious items, here's a breakdown of what you see:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Password inactive</strong>: If this were set to a positive number, I would have that many days to change an expired password before the system would lock out my account.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum number of days between password change</strong>: Because this is set to <code>0</code>, I can change my password as often as I like. If it were set to a positive number, I would have to wait that number of days after changing my password before I could change it again.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum number of days between password change</strong>: This is set to the default value of <code>99999</code>, meaning that my password will never expire.</li>
<li><strong>Number of days of warning before password expires</strong>: The default value is <code>7</code>, but that's rather meaningless when the password is set to never expire.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>With the <code>chage</code> utility, you can either set password and account expiration data for other users or use the <code>-l</code> option to view expiration data. Any unprivileged user can use <code>chage -l</code> without <code>sudo</code> to view his or her own data. To either set data or view someone else's data, you need <code>sudo</code>. We'll take a closer look at <code>chage</code> a bit later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before we look at how to change expiration data, let's first look at where the default settings are stored. We'll first look at the <code>/etc/login.defs</code> file. Here are the three relevant lines:</p>
<div><pre><code>PASS_MAX_DAYS 99999 
PASS_MIN_DAYS 0 
PASS_WARN_AGE 7</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You can edit these values to fit your organization's needs. For example, changing <code>PASS_MAX_DAYS</code> to a value of <code>30</code> would cause all new user passwords from that point on to have a 30-day expiration data. (By the way, setting the default password expiry data in <code>login.defs</code> works for all of the Linux distros that we’re using.)</p>


<h2 data-number="4.6">Configuring default expiry data for useradd for Red Hat-type systems only</h2>
<p>The <code>/etc/default/useradd</code> file has the rest of the default settings. In this case, we'll look at the one from the AlmaLinux 9 machine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ubuntu also has the <code>useradd</code> configuration file, but it doesn't work. No matter how you configure it, the Ubuntu version of <code>useradd</code> just won't read it. So, the write-up about this file only applies to Red Hat-type systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><pre><code># useradd defaults file
GROUP=100
HOME=/home 
INACTIVE=-1 
EXPIRE= 
SHELL=/bin/bash 
SKEL=/etc/skel 
CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The <code>EXPIRE=</code> line sets the default expiration date for new user accounts. By default, there is no default expiration date. <code>INACTIVE=-1</code> means that user accounts won't be automatically locked out after the users' passwords expire. If we set this to a positive number, then any new users will have that many days to change an expired password before the account gets locked. To change the defaults in the <code>useradd</code> file, you can either hand-edit the file or use <code>useradd -D</code> with the appropriate option switch for the item that you want to change. For example, to set a default expiration date of December 31, 2025, the command would be as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo useradd -D -e 2025-12-31</code></pre>
</div>
<p>To see the new configuration, you can either open the <code>useradd</code> file or just do <code>sudo useradd -D</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>[donnie@localhost ~]$ sudo useradd -D
 GROUP=100
 HOME=/home
 INACTIVE=-1
 EXPIRE=2023-12-31
 SHELL=/bin/bash
 SKEL=/etc/skel
 CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes
 [donnie@localhost ~]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You've now set it so that any new user accounts that get created will have the same expiration date. You can do the same thing with either the <code>INACTIVE</code> setting or the <code>SHELL</code> setting:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo useradd -D -f 5
sudo useradd -D -s /bin/zsh
 [donnie@localhost ~]$ sudo useradd -D
 GROUP=100
 HOME=/home
 INACTIVE=5
 EXPIRE=2019-12-31
 SHELL=/bin/zsh
 SKEL=/etc/skel
 CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=yes
 [donnie@localhost ~]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now, any new user accounts that get created will have the Zsh shell set as the default shell and will have to have expired passwords changed within five days to prevent having the account automatically locked out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>useradd</code> doesn't do any safety checks to ensure that the default shell that you've assigned is installed on the system. In our case, Zsh isn't installed, but <code>useradd</code> will still allow you to create accounts with Zsh as the default shell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, just how useful is this <code>useradd</code> configuration feature in real life? Probably not that much, unless you need to create a whole bunch of user accounts at once with the same settings. Even so, a savvy admin would just automate the process with a shell script, rather than messing around with this configuration file.</p>


<h2 data-number="4.7">Setting expiry data on a per-account basis with useradd and usermod</h2>
<p>You might find it useful to set the default password expiry data in <code>login.defs</code>, but you probably won't find it too useful to configure the <code>useradd</code> configuration file. Really, what are the chances that you'll want to create all user accounts with the same account expiration date? Setting password expiry data in <code>login.defs</code> is more useful because you'll just be saying that you want new passwords to expire within a certain number of days, rather than to have them all expire on a specific date.</p>
<p>Most likely, you'll want to set account expiry data on a per-account basis, depending on whether you know that the accounts will no longer be needed as of a specific date. There are three ways that you can do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>useradd</code> with the appropriate option switches to set expiry data as you create the accounts. (If you need to create a whole bunch of accounts at once with the same expiry data, you can automate the process with a shell script.)</li>
<li>Use <code>usermod</code> to modify expiry data on existing accounts. (The beautiful thing about <code>usermod</code> is that it uses the same option switches as <code>useradd</code>.)</li>
<li>Use <code>chage</code> to modify expiry data on existing accounts. (This one uses a whole different set of option switches.)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use <code>useradd</code> and <code>usermod</code> to set account expiry data, but not to set password expiry data. The only two option switches that affect account expiry data are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-e</code>: Use this to set an expiration date for the account, in the form YYYY-MM-DD.</li>
<li><code>-f</code>: Use this to set the number of days after the user's password expires that you want for his or her account to get locked out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's say that you want to create an account for Charlie that will expire at the end of 2025. On a Red Hat-type machine, you could enter this:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo useradd -e 2025-12-31 charlie</code></pre>
</div>
<p>On a non-Red Hat-type machine, you'd have to add the option switches that create the home directory and assign the correct default shell:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo useradd -m -d /home/charlie -s /bin/bash -e 2025-12-31 charlie</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Use <code>chage -l</code> to verify what you've entered:</p>
<div><pre><code>donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$ sudo chage -l charlie
 Last password change : Oct 06, 2017
 Password expires : never
 Password inactive : never
 Account expires : Dec 31, 2025
 Minimum number of days between password change : 0
 Maximum number of days between password change : 99999
 Number of days of warning before password expires : 7
 donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now, let's say that Charlie's contract has been extended, and you need to change his account expiration to the end of January 2026. You'll use <code>usermod</code> the same way on any Linux distro:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo usermod -e 2026-01-31 charlie</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Again, verify that everything is correct with <code>chage -l</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$ sudo chage -l charlie
 Last password change : Oct 06, 2017
 Password expires : never
 Password inactive : never
 Account expires : Jan 31, 2026
 Minimum number of days between password change : 0
 Maximum number of days between password change : 99999
 Number of days of warning before password expires : 7
 donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Optionally, you can set the number of days before an account with an expired password will get locked out:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo usermod -f 5 charlie</code></pre>
</div>
<p>But if you were to do that now, you wouldn't see any difference in the <code>chage -l</code> output because we still haven't set expiration data for Charlie's password.</p>


<h2 data-number="4.8">Setting expiry data on a per-account basis with chage</h2>
<p>You would only use <code>chage</code> to modify existing accounts, and you would use it for setting either an account expiration or a password expiration. Here are the relevant option switches:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Option</strong></td>
<td><strong>Explanation</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>-d</code></td>
<td>If you use the <code>-d 0</code> option on someone's account, you'll force the user to change his or her password on their next login.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>-E</code></td>
<td>This is equivalent to the lowercase <code>-e</code> for <code>useradd</code> or <code>usermod</code> . It sets the expiration date for the user account.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>-I</code></td>
<td>This is equivalent to <code>-f</code> for <code>useradd</code> or <code>usermod</code> . It sets the number of days before an account with an expired password will be locked out.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>-m</code></td>
<td>This sets the minimum number of days between password changes. In other words, if Charlie changes his password today, the <code>-m 5</code> option will force him to wait five days before he can change his password again.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>-M</code></td>
<td>This sets the maximum number of days before a password expires. (Be aware, though, that if Charlie last set his password 89 days ago, using a <code>-M 90</code> option on his account will cause his password to expire tomorrow, not 90 days from now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>-W</code></td>
<td>This will set the number of warning days for passwords that are about to expire.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You can set just one of these data items at a time or you can set them all at once. In fact, to avoid frustrating you with a different demo for each individual item, let's set them all at once, except for <code>-d 0</code>, and then we'll see what we've got:</p>
<div><pre><code>donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$ sudo chage -E 2026-02-28 -I 4 -m 3 -M 90 -W 4 charlie
donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$ sudo chage -l charlie
 Last password change : Oct 06, 2019
 Password expires : Jan 04, 2026
 Password inactive : Jan 08, 2026
 Account expires : Feb 28, 2026
 Minimum number of days between password change : 3
 Maximum number of days between password change : 90
 Number of days of warning before password expires : 4
donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>All expiration data have now been set.</p>
<p>For our final example, let's say that you've just created a new account for Samson, and you want to force him to change his password the first time he logs in. There are two ways to do that. Either way, you would do it after you've set his password initially, using one of these two commands:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo chage -d 0 samson
 or
sudo passwd -e samson
 
 donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$ sudo chage -l samson
 Last password change : password must be changed
 Password expires : password must be changed
 Password inactive : password must be changed
 Account expires : never
 Minimum number of days between password change : 0
 Maximum number of days between password change : 99999
 Number of days of warning before password expires : 7
 donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Next, we will go through a hands-on lab.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.8.1">Hands-on lab for setting account and password expiry data</h3>
<p>In this lab, you'll create a couple of new user accounts, set expiration data, and view the results. You can do this lab on any of your virtual machines. The only difference will be with the <code>useradd</code> commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your CentOS or AlmaLinux VM, create a user account for Samson with the expiration date of June 30, 2025, and view the results:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo useradd -e 2025-06-30 samson
sudo chage -l samson</code></pre>
</div>
<p>For Ubuntu, run these commands:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo useradd -m -d /home/samson -s /bin/bash -e 2025-06-30 samson
sudo chage -l samson</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>usermod</code> to change Samson's account expiration date to July 31, 2025:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo usermod -e 2025-07-31 samson
sudo chage -l samson</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Assign a password to Samson's account, then force him to change his password on his first login. Log in as Samson, change his password, then login to your own account:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo passwd samson
sudo passwd -e samson
sudo chage -l samson
su - samson
exit</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>chage</code> to set a five-day waiting period for changing passwords, a password expiration period of 90 days, an inactivity period of two days, and a warning period of five days:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo chage -m 5 -M 90 -I 2 -W 5 samson
sudo chage -l samson</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Keep this account, because you'll be using it for the lab in the next section.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, let's see how to prevent brute-force attacks.</p>



<h2 data-number="4.9">Preventing brute-force password attacks</h2>
<p>Amazingly enough, this is another topic that engenders a bit of controversy. I mean, nobody denies the wisdom of automatically locking out user accounts that are under attack. The controversial part concerns the number of failed login attempts that we should allow before locking the account.</p>
<p>Back in the stone age of computing, so long ago that I still had a full head of hair, the early Unix operating systems only allowed users to create a password with a maximum of eight lowercase letters. So in those days, it was possible for early man to brute-force someone else's password just by sitting down at the keyboard and typing in random passwords. That's when the philosophy started of having user accounts get locked out after only three failed login attempts. Nowadays, with strong passwords, or better yet, a strong passphrase, setting a lockout value of three failed login attempts will do three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will unnecessarily frustrate users.</li>
<li>It will cause extra work for help desk personnel.</li>
<li>If an account really is under attack, it will lock the account before you've had a chance to gather information about the attacker.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting the lockout value to something more realistic, such as 100 failed login attempts, will still provide good security, while still giving you enough time to gather information about the attackers. Just as importantly, you won't cause undue frustration to users and help desk personnel.</p>
<p>Anyway, regardless of how many failed login attempts your employer allows you to allow, you'll still need to know how to set it all up. On RHEL 7-type systems and Ubuntu 18.04, you’ll do this by configuring the <code>pam_tally2</code> <strong>Pluggable Authentication Module</strong> (<strong>PAM</strong>). On RHEL 8/9-type systems and Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, you’ll instead configure the <code>pam_faillock</code> PAM module. Let’s dig in and see how it’s done.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.9.1">Configuring the pam_tally2 PAM module on CentOS 7</h3>
<p>To make this magic work, we'll rely on our good friend, PAM. The <code>pam_tally2</code> module comes already installed on CentOS 7, but it isn't configured. We'll begin by editing the <code>/etc/pam.d/login</code> file. Figuring out how to configure it is easy because there's an example at the bottom of the <code>pam_tally2</code> man page:</p>
<div><pre><code>EXAMPLES
 Add the following line to /etc/pam.d/login to lock the account after
4 failed logins. Root account will be locked as well. The accounts will be
automatically unlocked after 20 minutes. The module does not have to be
called in the account phase because the login calls pam_setcred(3)
correctly.
 auth required pam_securetty.so
 auth required pam_tally2.so deny=4 even_deny_root
unlock_time=1200
 auth required pam_env.so
 auth required pam_unix.so
 auth required pam_nologin.so
 account required pam_unix.so
 password required pam_unix.so
 session required pam_limits.so
 session required pam_unix.so
 session required pam_lastlog.so nowtmp
 session optional pam_mail.so standard</code></pre>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re working with a text-mode server, you’ll only need to configure the <code>/etc/pam.d/login</code> file. But, if you’re working with a machine that’s running a graphical desktop environment, you’ll also need to configure the <code>/etc/pam.d/password.auth</code> and the <code>/etc/pam.d/system.auth</code> files. You’ll see how to do that when you get to the hands-on lab.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In the second line of the example, we see that <code>pam_tally2</code> is set with the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>deny=4</strong>: This means that the user account under attack will get locked out after only four failed login attempts.</li>
<li><strong>even_deny_root</strong>: This means that even the root user account will get locked if it's under attack.</li>
<li><strong>unlock_time=1200</strong>: The account will get automatically unlocked after 1,200 seconds, or 20 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if you look at the actual <code>login</code> file on your virtual machine, you'll see that it doesn’t look exactly like this example <code>login</code> file that's in the man page. That's okay, we'll still make it work.</p>
<p>Once you've configured the <code>login</code> file and have had a failed login, you'll see a new file created in the <code>/var/log</code> directory. You'll view information from that file with the <code>pam_tally2</code> utility. You can also use <code>pam_tally2</code> to manually unlock a locked account if you don't want to wait for the timeout period:</p>
<div><pre><code>donnie@centos7:~$ sudo pam_tally2
 Login Failures Latest failure From
 charlie 5 10/07/17 16:38:19
 donnie@centos7:~$ sudo pam_tally2 --user=charlie --reset
 Login Failures Latest failure From
 charlie 5 10/07/17 16:38:19
 donnie@centos7:~$ sudo pam_tally2
 donnie@centos7:~$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note that, after I did the reset on Charlie's account, I received no output from doing another query.</p>

<h4 data-number="4.9.1.1">Hands-on lab for configuring pam_tally2 on CentOS 7</h4>
<p>Configuring <code>pam_tally2</code> is super easy because it only requires adding one line to the <code>/etc/pam.d/login</code>, <code>/etc/pam.d/password.auth</code>, and <code>/etc/pam.d/system.auth</code> files. To make things even easier, you can just copy and paste that line from the example in the <code>pam_tally2</code> man page. In spite of what I said earlier about bumping the number of failed logins up to 100, we'll keep that number at 4 for now, because I know that you don't want to have to do 100 failed logins in order to demo this:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the CentOS 7 virtual machine, open the <code>/etc/pam.d/login</code> file for editing. Look for the line that invokes the <code>pam_securetty</code> module. (That should be around line 2.) Beneath that line, insert this line:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>auth required pam_tally2.so deny=4 even_deny_root unlock_time=1200</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Save the file and exit the editor.</p>
<p>Place the same line at the top of the <code>/etc/pam.d/password.auth</code> and <code>/etc/pam.d/system.auth</code> files, just above the first <code>auth required</code> line. (The comment at the top of these files says to not hand-edit them, because running <code>authconfig</code> will destroy the edits. Unfortunately, you have to hand edit them, because <code>authconfig</code> won’t configure this for you.)</p>
<ol>
<li>For this step, you'll need to log out of your own account, because <code>pam_tally2</code> doesn't work with <code>su</code>. So log out and, while purposely using the wrong password, attempt to log in to the <code>samson</code> account that you created in the previous lab. Keep doing that until you see the message that the account is locked. Note that when the <code>deny</code> value is set to <code>4</code>, it will actually take five failed login attempts to lock Samson out.</li>
<li>Log back in to your own user account. Run this command and note the output:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo pam_tally2</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>For this step, you'll simulate that you're a help desk worker, and Samson has just called to request that you unlock his account. After verifying that you really are talking to the real Samson, enter the following two commands:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo pam_tally2 --user=samson --reset
sudo pam_tally2</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Now that you've seen how this works, open the <code>/etc/pam.d/login</code> file for editing. Change the <code>deny=</code> parameter from <code>4 </code>to <code>100</code> and save the file. (This will make your configuration a bit more realistic in terms of modern security philosophy.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, let’s look at configuring <code>pam_faillock</code> on our AlmaLinux machines.</p>



<h3 data-number="4.9.2">Configuring pam_faillock on AlmaLinux 8/9</h3>
<p>The <code>pam_faillock</code> module is already installed on any RHEL 8 or RHEL 9-type of Linux distro. Since the basic concepts of <code>pam_faillock</code> are pretty much the same as they are for <code>pam_tally2</code>, we’ll dispense with the preliminary explanations and jump right to the hands-on procedure.</p>

<h4 data-number="4.9.2.1">Hands-on lab for configuring pam_faillock on AlmaLinux 8 or AlmaLinux 9</h4>
<p>Although you can enable and configure <code>pam_faillock</code> by hand-editing the PAM configuration files, the RHEL distros provide an easier method, which is called <strong>authselect</strong>. (Note that this procedure works exactly the same for either a text-mode or a GUI-type machine.)</p>
<ol>
<li>On either an AlmaLinux 8 or an AlmaLinux 9 VM, view the available authselect profiles by doing:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>[donnie@localhost ~]$ sudo authselect list
- minimal    Local users only for minimal installations
- sssd       Enable SSSD for system authentication (also for local users only)
- winbind    Enable winbind for system authentication
[donnie@localhost ~]$</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>For now, at least, we’re only dealing with local users. So, we’ll use the <strong>minimal</strong> profile. View the features of this profile like this:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>[donnie@localhost ~]$ sudo authselect list-features minimal
. . .
. . .
with-faillock
. . .
. . .
[donnie@localhost ~]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note that there are a lot of included features, but we’re only interested in the <code>with-faillock</code> feature.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable the minimal profile, like this:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo authselect select minimal --force</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>After enabling a profile, we can now enable the <code>pam_faillock</code> module, like this:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo authselect enable-feature with-faillock</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>In the <code>/etc/security/</code> directory, open the <code>faillock.conf</code> file in your favorite text editor. Look for these four lines:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code># silent
# deny = 3
# unlock_time = 600
# even_deny_root</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Remove the preceding comment symbols from all four lines, and save the file.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a user account for Vicky by doing:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo useradd vicky
sudo passwd vicky</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Open another terminal, and have Vicky deliberately make three failed login attempts. View the results in your own terminal, like this:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>[donnie@localhost ~]$ sudo faillock
donnie:
When                Type  Source                                           Valid
vicky:
When                Type  Source                                           Valid
2022-10-12 15:54:35 RHOST 192.168.0.16                                         V
2022-10-12 15:54:42 RHOST 192.168.0.16                                         V
2022-10-12 15:54:46 RHOST 192.168.0.16                                         V
[donnie@localhost ~]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Then, before the timer expires, have Vicky try to log in again with her own correct password.</p>
<ol>
<li>After the ten-minute timer expires, have Vicky try to log in with the correct password.</li>
<li>Have the user log out. Then, have the user again deliberately make three failed login attempts. This time, reset the user’s account before the timer expires, like this:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>sudo faillock --reset --user vicky</code></pre>
</div>
<p>That’s it for this lab.</p>
<p>Doing this on Ubuntu is a bit different, so let’s now look at that.</p>



<h3 data-number="4.9.3">Configuring pam_faillock on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04</h3>
<p>Sadly, the <code>authselect</code> utility isn’t available for Ubuntu, so we’ll just have to hand-edit the PAM configuration files. Here’s the procedure.</p>

<h4 data-number="4.9.3.1">Hands-on lab for configuring pam_faillock on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04</h4>
<ol>
<li>Open the <code>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</code> file in your favorite text editor. At the top of the file, insert these two lines:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>auth        required                                     pam_faillock.so preauth silent
       auth        required                                     pam_faillock.so authfail</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Open the <code>/etc/pam.d/common-account</code> file in your text editor. At the bottom of the file, add this line:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>account     required                                     pam_faillock.so</code></pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Configure the <code>/etc/security/faillock.conf</code> file the same way that I showed you in Step 5 of the preceding lab for AlmaLinux.</li>
<li>Test the setup as outlined in Steps 6 through 8 of the preceding AlmaLinux lab.</li>
<li>And, that’s all there is to it. Next, let’s look at how to manually lock a user’s account.</li>
</ol>



<h3 data-number="4.9.4">Locking user accounts</h3>
<p>Okay, you've just seen how to have Linux automatically lock user accounts that are under attack. There will also be times when you'll want manually lock out user accounts. Let's look at a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user goes on vacation and you want to ensure that nobody monkeys around with that user's account while he or she is gone</li>
<li>When a user is under investigation for questionable activities</li>
<li>When a user leaves the company</li>
</ul>
<p>With regard to the last point, you may be asking yourself, <em>Why can't we just delete the accounts of people who are no longer working here?</em> And, you certainly can, easily enough. However, before you do so, you'll need to check with your local laws to make sure that you don't get yourself into deep trouble. Here in the United States, for example, we have the <strong>Sarbanes-Oxley</strong> law, which restricts what files that publicly traded companies can delete from their computers. If you were to delete a user account, along with that user's home directory and mail spool, you just might be running afoul of Sarbanes-Oxley or whatever you may have as the equivalent law in your own home country.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are two utilities that you can use to temporarily lock a user account:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>usermod</strong></li>
<li><strong>passwd</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In apparent contradiction to what I just said, at some point you will need to remove inactive user accounts. That's because malicious actors can use an inactive account to perform their dirty deeds, especially if that inactive account had any sort of administrative privileges. But when you do remove the accounts, make sure that you do so in accordance with local laws and with company policy. In fact, your best bet is to ensure that your organization has written guidelines for removing inactive user accounts in its change management procedures.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.9.5">Using usermod to lock a user account</h3>
<p>Let's say that Katelyn has gone on maternity leave and will be gone for several weeks. We can lock her account by doing:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo usermod -L katelyn</code></pre>
</div>
<p>When you look at Katelyn's entry in the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file, you'll now see an exclamation point in front of her password hash, like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>katelyn:!$6$uA5ecH1A$MZ6q5U.cyY2SRSJezV000AudP.ckXXndBNsXUdMI1vPO8aFmlLXcbGV25K5HSSaCv4RlDilwzlXq/hKvXRkpB/:17446:0:99999:7:::</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This exclamation point prevents the system from reading her password hash, which effectively locks her out of the system.</p>
<p>To unlock her account, just do this:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo usermod -U katelyn</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You'll see that the exclamation point has been removed so that she can now log in to her account.</p>


<h3 data-number="4.9.6">Using passwd to lock user accounts</h3>
<p>You could also lock Katelyn's account like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo passwd -l katelyn</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This does the same job as <code>usermod -L</code>, but in a slightly different manner. For one thing, <code>passwd -l</code> will give you some feedback about what's going on, whereas <code>usermod -L</code> gives you no feedback at all. On Ubuntu, the feedback looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$ sudo passwd -l katelyn
 passwd: password expiry information changed.
 donnie@ubuntu-steemnode:~$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>On CentOS or AlmaLinux, the feedback looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>[donnie@localhost ~]$ sudo passwd -l katelyn
 Locking password for user katelyn.
 passwd: Success
 [donnie@localhost ~]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Also, on a CentOS or AlmaLinux machine, you'll see that <code>passwd -l</code> places two exclamation points in front of the password hash, instead of just one. Either way, the effect is the same.</p>
<p>To unlock Katelyn's account, just do this:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo passwd -u katelyn</code></pre>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>In versions of Red Hat or CentOS prior to version 7, <code>usermod -U</code> would remove only one of the exclamation points that <code>passwd -l</code> places in front of the <code>shadow</code> file password hash, thereby leaving the account still locked. No big deal, though, because running <code>usermod -U</code> again would remove the second exclamation point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever since the introduction of the RHEL 7-type distros, this has been fixed. The <code>passwd -l</code> command still places two exclamation points in the <code>shadow</code> file, but <code>usermod -U</code> now removes both of them. (That's a shame, really, because it ruined a perfectly good demo that I liked to do for my students.)</p>

<h2 data-number="4.10">Locking the root user account</h2>
<p>The cloud is big business nowadays, and it's now quite common to rent a virtual private server from companies such as Rackspace, DigitalOcean, or Microsoft Azure. These can serve a variety of purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can run your own website, where you install your own server software instead of letting a hosting service do it.</li>
<li>You can set up a web-based app for other people to access.</li>
<li>Recently, I saw a YouTube demo on a crypto-mining channel that showed how to set up a Proof of Stake master node on a rented virtual private server.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that most of these cloud services have in common is that when you first set up your account and the provider sets up a virtual machine for you, they'll have you log in to the root user account. (It even happens with Ubuntu, even though the root account is disabled on a local installation of Ubuntu.)</p>
<p>I know that there are some folk who just keep logging in to the root account of these cloud-based servers and think nothing of it, but that's really a horrible idea. There are botnets, such as the Hail Mary botnet, that continuously scan the Internet for servers that have their Secure Shell port exposed to the Internet. When the botnets find one, they'll do a brute-force password attack against the root user account of that server. And yes, the botnets sometimes are successful in breaking in, especially if the root account is set with a weak password.</p>
<p>So, the first thing that you want to do when you set up a cloud-based server is to create a normal user account for yourself and set it up with full <code>sudo</code> privileges. Then, log out of the root user account, log in to your new account, and do this:</p>
<div><pre><code>sudo passwd -l root</code></pre>
</div>
<p>I mean, really, why take the chance of getting your root account compromised?</p>


<h2 data-number="4.11">Setting up security banners</h2>
<p>Something that you really, really don't want is to have a login banner that says something to the effect of <em>Welcome to our network</em>. I say that because, quite a few years ago, I attended a mentored SANS course on incident handling. Our instructor told us a story about how a company took a suspected network intruder to court, only to get the case thrown out. The reason? The alleged intruder said, "<em>Well, I saw the message that said Welcome to the network, so I thought that I really was welcome there."</em> Yeah, supposedly, that was enough to get the case thrown out.</p>
<p>A few years later, I related that story to the students in one of my Linux admin classes. One student said, "<em>That makes no sense.</em> <em>We all have welcome mats at our front doors, but that doesn't mean that burglars are welcome to come in.</em>" I have to confess that he had a good point, and I now have to wonder about the veracity of the story.</p>
<p>At any rate, just to be on the safe side, you do want to set up login messages that make clear that only authorized users are allowed to access the system.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.11.1">Using the motd file</h3>
<p>The <code>/etc/motd</code> file will present a message banner to anyone who logs in to a system through Secure Shell. On your CentOS or AlmaLinux machine, an empty <code>motd</code> file is already there. On your Ubuntu machine, the <code>motd</code> file isn't there, but it's a simple matter to create one. Either way, open the file in your text editor and create your message. Save the file and test it by remotely logging in through Secure Shell. You should see something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code> maggie@192.168.0.100&#39;s password:

 [maggie@localhost ~]$
motd stands for Message of the Day.</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Ubuntu comes with a dynamic MOTD system that displays messages from Ubuntu's parent company and messages about the operating system. When you create a new <code>motd</code> file in the <code>/etc</code> directory, whatever message you put in it will show up at the end of the dynamic output, like so:</p>
<div><pre><code>Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-48-generic x86_64)

<h3 data-number="4.11.2">Using the issue file</h3>
<p>The <code>issue</code> file, also found in the <code>/etc</code> directory, shows a message on the local terminal, just above the login prompt. A default <code>issue</code> file would just contain macro code that would show information about the machine. Here's an example from an Ubuntu machine:</p>
<div><pre><code>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS \n \l</code></pre>
</div>
<p>On a Red Hat-type machine, it would look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>\S
Kernel \r on an \m</code></pre>
</div>
<p>On an Ubuntu machine, the banner would look something like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/file28.png" alt="19501_03_01.png" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">19501_03_01.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On a a Red Hat-type machine, it would look something like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/file29.png" alt="19501_03_02.png" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">19501_03_02.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You could put a security message in the <code>issue</code> file, and it would show up after a reboot:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/file30.png" alt="19501_03_03.png" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">19501_03_03.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In reality, is there really any point in placing a security message in the <code>issue</code> file? If your servers are properly locked away in a server room with controlled access, then probably not. For desktop machines that are out in the open, this would be more useful.</p>


<h3 data-number="4.11.3">Using the issue.net file</h3>
<p>Just don't. It's for <code>telnet</code> logins, and anyone who has <code>telnet</code> enabled on their servers is seriously screwing up. However, for some strange reason, the <code>issue.net</code> file still hangs around in the <code>/etc</code> directory.</p>



<h2 data-number="4.12">Detecting compromised passwords</h2>
<p>Yes, dear hearts, the bad guys do have extensive dictionaries of passwords that either are commonly used or have been compromised. One of the most effective ways of brute-forcing passwords is to use these dictionaries to perform a dictionary attack. This is when the password-cracking tool reads in passwords from a specified dictionary and tries each one until either the list has been exhausted, or until the attack is successful. So, how do you know if your password is on one of those lists? Easy. Just use one of the online services that will check your password for you. One popular site is <em>Have I Been Pwned?</em>, which you can see here:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/file31.png" alt="19501_03_04.png" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">19501_03_04.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>You can get to <em>Have I Been Pwned?</em> here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">https://haveibeenpwned.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>All you really have to do is to type in your password, and the service will show if it's on any lists of compromised passwords. But think about it. Do you really want to send your production password to somebody's website? Yeah, I thought not. Instead, let's just send a hash value of the password. Better yet, let's just send enough of the hash to allow the site to find the password in its database, but not so much that they can figure out what your exact password is. We'll do that by using the <em>Have I Been Pwned?</em> <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong> (<strong>API</strong>).</p>
<p>To demonstrate the basic principle, let's use <code>curl</code>, along with the API, to see a list of password hashes that have <code>21BD1</code> as part of their values. (You can do this on any of your virtual machines. I'll just do it on the Fedora workstation that I'm currently using to type this.) Just run this:</p>
<div><pre><code>curl https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/21BD1</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You're going to get a lot of output like this, so I'll just show the first few lines:</p>
<div><pre><code> [donnie@fedora-teaching ~]$ curl https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/21BD1

. . .
. . .</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Let's pipe this into <code>wc -l</code>, a handy counting utility, to see how many matching results we've found:</p>
<div><pre><code> [donnie@fedora-teaching ~]$ curl https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/21BD1 | wc -l
 % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current
 Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed
 100 20592 0 20592 0 0 197k 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 199k
 526
 [donnie@fedora-teaching ~]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>According to this, we've found 526 matches. But that's not very useful, so let's fancy things up just a bit. We'll do that by creating the <code>pwnedpasswords.sh</code> shell script, which looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash
candidate_password=$1
echo &quot;Candidate password: $candidate_password&quot;
full_hash=$(echo -n $candidate_password | sha1sum | awk &#39;{print substr($1, 0, 32)}&#39;)
prefix=$(echo $full_hash | awk &#39;{print substr($1, 0, 5)}&#39;)
suffix=$(echo $full_hash | awk &#39;{print substr($1, 6, 26)}&#39;)
if curl https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/$prefix | grep -i $suffix;
 then echo &quot;Candidate password is compromised&quot;;
 else echo &quot;Candidate password is OK for use&quot;;
fi</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Okay, I can't try to turn you into a shell scripting guru at the moment, but here's the simplified explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>candidate_password=$1</strong>: This requires you to enter the password that you want to check when you invoke the script.</li>
<li><strong>full_hash=</strong> , <strong>prefix=</strong>, <strong>suffix=</strong>: These lines calculate the SHA1 hash value of the password, and then extract just the portions of the hash that we want to send to the password-checking service.</li>
<li><strong>if curl</strong>: We wrap up with an <code>if..then..else</code> structure that sends the selected portions of the password hash to the checking service, and then tells us whether or not the password has been compromised.</li>
</ul>
<p>After saving the file, add the executable privilege for the user, like so:</p>
<div><pre><code>chmod u+x pwnedpasswords.sh</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now, let's see if <code>TurkeyLips</code>, my all-time favorite password, has been compromised:</p>
<div><pre><code> [donnie@fedora-teaching ~]$ ./pwnedpasswords.sh TurkeyLips
 Candidate password: TurkeyLips
 % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current
 Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed
 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 09FDEDF4CA44D6B432645D6C1D3A8D4A16BD:2
 100 21483 0 21483 0 0 107k 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 107k
 Candidate password is compromised
 [donnie@fedora-teaching ~]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Yeah, it's been compromised, all right. So, I reckon that I don't want to use that for a production password.</p>
<p>Now, let's try it again, except with a random two-digit number tacked on at the end:</p>
<div><pre><code> [donnie@fedora-teaching ~]$ ./pwnedpasswords.sh TurkeyLips98
 Candidate password: TurkeyLips98
 % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current
 Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed
 100 20790 0 20790 0 0 110k 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 110k
 Candidate password is OK for use
 [donnie@fedora-teaching ~]$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Well, it says that this one is okay. Still though, you probably don't want to use such a simple permutation of a password that's known to have been compromised.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to take credit for the shell script that I've presented here, but I can't. That was a creation of my buddy, Leo Dorrendorf of the former VDOO Internet of Things security company, which has since been acquired by JFrog. (I've reproduced the script here with his kind permission.)</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Full disclosure: the VDOO/JFrog company has been one of my clients.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, having said all of this, I still need to remind you that a passphrase is still better than a password. Not only is a passphrase harder to crack, it's also much less likely to be on anyone's list of compromised credentials.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.12.1">Hands-on lab for detecting compromised passwords</h3>
<p>In this lab, you'll use the <code>pwnedpasswords</code> API in order to check your own passwords:</p>

<p>The user management techniques that we've looked at so far work great on a small number of computers. But what if you're working in a large enterprise? We'll look at that next.</p>



<h2 data-number="4.13">Understanding centralized user management</h2>
<p>In an enterprise setting, you'll often have hundreds or thousands of users and computers that you need to manage. So, logging in to each network server or each user's workstation to perform the procedures that we've just outlined would be quite unworkable. (But do bear in mind that you still need those skills.) What we need is a way to manage computers and users from one central location. Space doesn't permit me to give the complete details about the various methods for doing this. So for now, we'll just have to settle for a high-level overview.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.13.1">Microsoft Active Directory</h3>
<p>I'm not exactly a huge fan of either Windows or Microsoft. But when it comes to Active Directory, I'll have to give credit where it's due. It's a pretty slick product that vastly simplifies the management of very large enterprise networks. And yes, it is possible to add Unix/Linux computers and their users to an Active Directory domain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been keeping a dark secret, and I hope that you won't hate me for it. Before I got into Linux, I obtained my MCSE certification for Windows Server 2003. Mostly, my clients work with nothing but Linux computers, but I occasionally do need to use my MCSE skills. Several years ago, a former client needed me to set up a Linux-based Nagios server as part of a Windows Server 2008 domain, so that its users would be authenticated by Active Directory. It took me a while to get it figured out, but I finally did, and my client was happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless you wear many hats, as I sometimes have to do, you—as a Linux administrator—probably won't need to learn how to use Active Directory. Most likely, you'll just tell the Windows Server administrators what you need, and let them take care of it.</p>
<p>I know, you've been chomping at the bit to see what we can do with a Linux server. So, here goes.</p>



<h2 data-number="4.14">Samba on Linux</h2>
<p>Samba is a Unix/Linux daemon that can serve three purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its primary purpose is to share directories from a Unix/Linux server with Windows workstations. The directories show up in the Windows File Explorer as if they were being shared from other Windows machines.</li>
<li>It can also be set up as a network print server.</li>
<li>It can also be set up as a Windows domain controller.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can install Samba version 3 on a Linux server, and set it up to act as an old-style Windows NT domain controller. It's a rather complex procedure, and it takes a while. Once it's done, you can join both Linux and Windows machines to the domain and use the normal Windows user management utilities to manage users and groups.</p>
<p>One of the Linux community's Holy Grails was to figure out how to emulate Active Directory on a Linux server. That became something of a reality just a few years ago, with the introduction of Samba version 4. But setting it up is a very complex procedure, and isn't something that you'll likely enjoy doing. So, perhaps we should keep searching for something even better.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.14.1">FreeIPA/Identity Management on RHEL-type distros</h3>
<p>Several years ago, the Red Hat company introduced FreeIPA as a set of packages for Fedora. Why Fedora? It's because they wanted to give it a thorough test on Fedora before making it available for actual production networks. It's now available for RHEL 7 through RHEL 9 and all of their offspring, including CentOS and AlmaLinux. This is what IPA stands for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity</li>
<li>Policy</li>
<li>Audit</li>
</ul>
<p>It's something of an answer to Microsoft's Active Directory, but it still isn't a complete one. It does some cool stuff, but it's still very much a work in progress. The coolest part about it is how simple it is to install and set up. All it really takes is to install the packages from the normal repositories, open the proper firewall ports, and then run a setup script. Then, you're all set to start adding users and computers to the new domain via FreeIPA's web interface. Here, I'm adding Cleopatra, my gray-and-white tabby kitty:</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/file32.png" alt="19501_03_05.png" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">19501_03_05.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Although you can add Windows machines to a FreeIPA domain, it's not recommended. But, starting with RHEL/CentOS 7.1, you can use FreeIPA to create cross-domain trusts with an Active Directory domain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The official name of this program is FreeIPA. But, for some strange reason, the Red Hat folk refuse to mention that name in their documentation. They always just refer to it as either Identity Management or IdM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's pretty much it for the user management topic. Let's summarize, and then move on to the next chapter.</p>



<h2 data-number="4.15">Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we looked at how to lock down users' home directories, how to enforce strong password policies, and how to enforce account and password expiration policies. Then, we talked about a way to prevent brute-force password attacks, how to manually lock out user accounts, how to set up security banners, and how to check for compromised passwords. We wrapped things up with a brief overview of central user management systems.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll look at how to work with various firewall utilities. I'll see you there.</p>
