                <h1 class="header-title">Introduction</h1>
            

            
                
<p>The more time you spend developing applications the more you come to appreciate software that tracks your revision history. A revision control system lets you create a sandbox for new approaches to problems, maintain multiple branches of released code, and provide a development history in the event of intellectual property disputes. Linux and Unix support many source code control systems ranging from the early and primitive SCCS and RCS to concurrent systems such as <strong>CVS</strong> and <strong>SVN</strong> and the modern distributed development systems such as <strong>GIT</strong> and <strong>FOSSIL</strong>.</p>
<p>The big advantage of Git and Fossil over older systems such as CVS and SVN is that a developer can use them without being connected to a network. Older systems such as CVS and RCS worked fine when you were at the office, but you could not check the new code or examine the old code while working remotely.</p>
<p>Git and Fossil are two different revision control systems with some similarities and some differences. Both support the distributed development model of revision control. Git provides source code control and has a number of add-on applications for more information while Fossil is a single executable that provides revision control, trouble tickets, a Wiki, web pages and technical notes.</p>
<p>Git is used for the Linux kernel development and has been adopted by many open source developers. Fossil was designed for the SQLite development team and is also widely used in both the open source and closed source communities.</p>
<p>Git is included with most Linux distributions. If it's not available on your system, you can install it with either yum (Redhat or SuSE) or apt-get (Debian or Ubuntu).</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ sudo yum install git-all</strong>
<strong>    $ sudo apt-get install git-all</strong>
</pre>
<p>Fossil is available as source or executable from <a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org" target="_blank">http://www.fossil-scm.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Using Git</strong></p>
<p>The git system uses the <kbd>git</kbd> command with many subcommands to perform individual actions. We'll discuss git clone, git commit, git branch, and others.</p>
<p>To use git you need a code repository. You can either create one yourself (for your projects) or clone a remote repository.</p>

<p>If you are working on your own project, you will want to create your own repository. You can create the repository on your local system, or on a remote site such as GitHub.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
            

            
                
<p>All projects in git need a master folder that holds the rest of the project files.</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ mkdir MyProject</strong>
<strong>    $ cd MyProject</strong>
</pre>

                <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
            

            
                
<p>The <kbd>git init</kbd> command creates the <kbd>.git</kbd> subfolder within your current working directory and initializes the files that configure <kbd>git</kbd>.</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git init</strong>
</pre>

                <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
            

            
                
<p>The <kbd>git init</kbd> command initializes a <kbd>git</kbd> repository for local use. If you want to allow remote users access this repository, you need to enable that with the <kbd>update-server-info</kbd> command:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git update-server-info</strong>
</pre>

                <h1 class="header-title">Cloning a remote git repository</h1>
            

            
                
<p>If you intend to access someone else's project, either to contribute new code or just to use the project, you'll need to clone the code to your system.</p>
<p>You need to be online to clone a repository. Once you've copied the files to your system, you can commit new code, backtrack to older revisions, and so on. You can't send any new code changes upstream to the site you cloned from until you are online again.</p>


            

            <footer style="margin-top: 5em;">

                <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
            

            
                
<p>The <kbd>git clone</kbd> command copies files from the remote site to your local system. The remote site might be an anonymous repository such as GitHub, or a system where you need to log in with an account name and perhaps password.</p>
<p>Clone from a known remote site such as GitHub:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git clone http://github.com/ProjectName</strong>
</pre>
<p>Clone from a login/password protected site (perhaps your own server):</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git clone clif@172.16.183.130:gitTest</strong>
<strong>    clif@172.16.183.130's password:</strong>
</pre>

                <h1 class="header-title">Adding and committing changes with git</h1>
            

            
                
<p>With distributed version control systems such as git, you do most of your work with your local copy of the repository. You can add new code, change code, test, revise, and finally commit the fully tested code. This encourages frequent small commits on your local repository and one large commit when the code is stable.</p>


            

            <footer style="margin-top: 5em;">
                
            </footer>

        
    

        

            
                <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
            

            
                
<p>The <kbd>git add</kbd> command adds a change in your working code to the staging area. It does not change the repository, it just marks this change as one to be included with the next commit:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ vim SomeFile.sh</strong>
<strong>    $ git add SomeFile.sh</strong>
</pre>
<p>Doing a <kbd>git add</kbd> after every edit session is a good policy if you want to be certain you don't accidently leave out a change when you commit your changes.</p>
<p>You can also add new files to your repository with the git add command:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ echo "my test file" &gt;testfile.txt</strong>
<strong>    $ git add testfile.txt</strong>
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can add multiple files:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git add *.c</strong>
</pre>
<p>The <kbd>git commit</kbd> command commits the changes to the repository:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ vim OtherFile.sh</strong>
<strong>    $ git add OtherFile.sh</strong>
<strong>    $ git commit</strong>
</pre>
<p>The <kbd>git commit</kbd> command will open the editor defined in your <strong>EDITOR</strong> shell variable and pre-populate like this:</p>
<pre>
    <strong># Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting   
    # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit. </strong>
<strong>    #</strong>
<strong>    # Committer: Clif Flynt &lt;clif@cflynt.com&gt;</strong>
<strong>    #</strong>
<strong>    # On branch branch1</strong>
<strong>    # Changes to be committed:</strong>
<strong>    #   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)</strong>
<strong>    #</strong>
<strong>    #       modified:   SomeFile.sh</strong>
<strong>    #       modified:   OtherFile.sh</strong>
</pre>
<p>After you enter a comment your changes will be saved in your local copy of the repository.</p>
<p>This does not push your changes to the main repository (perhaps <kbd>github</kbd>), but other developers can <strong>pull</strong> the new code from your repository if they have an account on your system.</p>
<p>You can shorten the add/commit events with the <kbd>-a</kbd> and <kbd>-m</kbd> arguments to commit:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>-a</kbd>: This adds the new code before committing</li>
<li><kbd>-m</kbd>: This defines a message without going into the editor</li>
</ul>
<pre>
    <strong>git commit -am "Add and Commit all modified files."</strong>
</pre>

                <h1 class="header-title">Creating and merging branches with git</h1>
            

            
                
<p>If you are maintaining an application you may need to return to an earlier branch to test. For instance, the bug you're fixing may have been around, but unreported, for a long time. You'll want to find when the bug was introduced to track down the code that introduced it. (Refer to <kbd>git bisect</kbd> in the <em>Finding bugs</em> recipe in this chapter.)</p>
<p>When you add new features, you should create a new branch to identify your changes. The project maintainer can then merge the new branch into the master branch after the new code is tested and validated. You can change and create new branches with the git's <kbd>checkout</kbd> subcommand.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
            

            
                
<p>To change to a previously defined branch:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git checkout OldBranchName</strong>
</pre>

<p>The checkout subcommand examines the <kbd>.git</kbd> folder on your system and restores the snapshot associated with the desired branch.</p>
<p>Note that you cannot change to an existing branch if you have uncommitted changes in your current workspace.</p>
<p>You can create a new branch when you have uncommitted changes in the current workspaces. To create a new branch, use git checkout's <kbd>-b</kbd> option:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git checkout -b MyBranchName</strong>
<strong>    Switched to a new branch 'MyBranchName'</strong>
</pre>
<p>This defines your current working branch to be <kbd>MyBranchName</kbd>. It sets a pointer to match <kbd>MyBranchName</kbd> to the previous branch. As you add and commit changes, the pointer will diverge further from the initial branch.</p>
<p>When you've tested the code in your new branch, you can merge the changes back into the branch you started from.</p>

<p>You can view the branches with the <kbd>git branch</kbd> command:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git branch</strong>
<strong>    * MyBranchName</strong>
<strong>    master</strong>
</pre>
<p>The current branch is highlighted with an asterisk (<kbd>*</kbd>).</p>

<p>After you've edited, added, tested, and committed, you'll want to merge your changes back into the initial branch.</p>


            

            <footer style="margin-top: 5em;">

<p>After you've created a new branch and added and committed your changes, change back to the original branch and use the <kbd>git merge</kbd> command to merge the changes in your new branch:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git checkout originalBranch </strong>
<strong>    $ git checkout -b modsToOriginalBranch</strong>
<strong>    # Edit, test</strong>
<strong>    $ git commit -a -m "Comment on modifications to originalBranch"</strong>
<strong>    $ git checkout originalBranch  </strong>
<strong>    $ git merge modsToOriginalBranch</strong>
</pre>

<p>The first <kbd>git checkout</kbd> command retrieves the snapshot for the starting branch. The second <kbd>git checkout</kbd> command marks your current working code as also being a new branch.</p>
<p>The <kbd>git commit</kbd> command (or commands) move the snapshot pointer for the new branch further and further away from the original branch. The third <kbd>git checkout</kbd> command restores your code to the initial state before you made your edits and commits.</p>
<p>The <kbd>git merge</kbd> command moves the snapshot pointer for the initial branch to the snapshot of the branch you are merging.</p>


            

            <footer style="margin-top: 5em;">

<p>After you merge a branch, you may not need it any longer. The <kbd>-d</kbd> option will delete the branch:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git branch -d MyBranchName</strong>
</pre>

                <h1 class="header-title">Sharing your work</h1>
            

            
                
<p>Git lets you work without connecting to the Internet. Eventually, you'll want to share your work.</p>
<p>There are two ways to do this, creating a patch or pushing your new code to the master repository.</p>
<p><strong>Making a patch...</strong></p>
<p>A patch file is a description of the changes that have been committed. Another developer can apply your patch files to their code to use your new code.</p>
<p>The format-patch command will collect your changes and create one or more patch files. The patch files will be named with a number, a description and <kbd>.patch</kbd>.</p>


            

            <footer style="margin-top: 5em;">

                <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
            

            
                
<p>The format-patch command requires an identifier to tell Git what the first patch should be. Git will create as many patch files as it needs to change code from what it was then to what it should be.</p>
<p>There are several ways to identify the starting snapshot. One common use for a set of patches is to submit the changes you've made to a given branch to the package maintainer.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you've created a new branch off the master for a new feature. When you've completed your testing, you may send a set of patch files to the project maintainer so they can validate your work and merge the new feature into the project.</p>
<p>The <kbd>format-patch</kbd> sub-command with the name of a parent branch will generate the patch file to create your current branch:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git checkout master</strong>
<strong>    $ git checkout -b newFeature</strong>
<strong>    # Edits, adds and commits.</strong>
<strong>    $ git format-patch master</strong>
<strong>    0001-Patch-add-new-feature-to-menu.patch</strong>
<strong>    0002-Patch-support-new-feature-in-library.patch</strong>
</pre>
<p>Another common identifier is a git snapshot <strong>SHA1</strong>. Each git snapshot is identified by an SHA1 string.</p>
<p>You can view a log of all the commits in your repository with the <kbd>git log</kbd> command:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git log</strong>
<strong>    commit 82567395cb97876e50084fd29c93ccd3dfc9e558</strong>
<strong>    Author: Clif Flynt &lt;clif@example.com&gt;</strong>
<strong>    Date:   Thu Dec 15 13:38:28 2016 -0500</strong>

<strong>    Fixed reported bug #1</strong>

<strong>    commit 721b3fee54e73fd9752e951d7c9163282dcd66b7</strong>
<strong>    Author: Clif Flynt &lt;clif@example.com&gt;</strong>
<strong>    Date:   Thu Dec 15 13:36:12 2016 -0500</strong>

<strong>    Created new feature</strong>
</pre>
<p>The <kbd>git format-patch</kbd> command with an SHA1 identifier looks like this:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git format-patch SHA1</strong>
</pre>
<p>You can use a unique leading segment of the SHA1 identifier or the full, long string:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git format-patch 721b</strong>
<strong>    $ git format-patch 721b3fee54e73fd9752e951d7c9163282dcd66b7</strong>
</pre>
<p>You can also identify a snapshot by its distance from your current location with a <kbd>-#</kbd> option.</p>
<p>This command will make a patch file for the most recent change to the master branch:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git format-patch -1 master</strong>
</pre>
<p>This command will make a patch file for the two most recent changes to the <kbd>bleedingEdge</kbd> branch:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git format-patch -2 bleedingEdge</strong>
</pre>
<p><strong>Applying a patch</strong></p>
<p>The <kbd>git apply</kbd> command applies a patch to your working code set. You'll have to check out the appropriate snapshot before running this command.</p>
<p>You can test that the patch is valid with the <kbd>--check</kbd> option.</p>
<p>If your environment is correct for this patch, there will be no return. If you don't have the correct branch checked out, the patch <kbd>-check</kbd> command will generate an error condition:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git apply --check 0001-Patch-new-feature.patch</strong>
<strong>    error: patch failed: feature.txt:2</strong>

<p>If you have a unique branch, it can always be pushed to the master repository:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git push origin MyBranchName</strong>
</pre>
<p>If you've modified an existing branch, you may receive an error message as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>remote: error</kbd>: Refusing to update checked out branch: <kbd>refs/heads/master</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>remote: error</kbd>: By default, updating the current branch in a non-bare repository</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, you need to push your changes to a new branch on the remote site:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git push origin master:NewBranchName</strong>
</pre>
<p>You'll also need to alert the package maintainer to merge this branch into the master:</p>
<pre>
    <strong># On remote</strong>
<strong>    $ git merge NewBranchName</strong>
</pre>
<p>Retrieving the latest sources for the current branch. If there are multiple developers on a project, you'll need to synchronize with the remote repository occasionally to retrieve data that's been pushed by other developers.</p>
<p>The <kbd>get fetch</kbd> and <kbd>git pull</kbd> commands will download data from the remote site to your local repository.</p>
<p>Update your repository without changing the working code.</p>
<p>The <kbd>git fetch</kbd> and <kbd>git pull</kbd> command will download new code but not modify your working code set.</p>
<pre>
    <strong>get fetch SITENAME</strong>
</pre>
<p>The site you cloned your repository from is named origin:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ get fetch origin</strong>
</pre>
<p>To fetch from another developer's repository, use the following command:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ get fetch Username@Address:Project</strong>
</pre>
<p>Update your repository and the working code.</p>
<p>The <kbd>git pull</kbd> command performs a fetch and then merges the changes into your current code. This will fail if there are conflicts you need to resolve:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git pull origin</strong>
<strong>    $ git pull Username@Address:Project</strong>
</pre>

<p>Even the best testing groups let bugs slip out into the field. When that happens, it's up to the developers to figure out what the bug is and how to fix it.</p>
<p>Git has tools to help.</p>
<p>Nobody deliberately creates bugs, so the problem is probably caused by fixing an old bug or adding a new feature.</p>
<p>If you can isolate the code that causes the issue, use the <kbd>git blame</kbd> command to find who committed the code that caused the problem and what the commit SHA code was.</p>


            

            <footer style="margin-top: 5em;">

<p>The <kbd>git blame</kbd> command returns a list of commit hash codes, author, date, and the first line of the commit message:</p>
<pre>

                <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
            

            
                
<p>If you have a test that indicates the problem, but don't know the line of code that's at issue, you can use the <kbd>git bisect</kbd> command to find the commit that introduced the problem.</p>

<p>The <kbd>git bisect</kbd> command requires two identifiers, one for the last known good code and one for the bad release. The bisect command will identify a revision midway between the good and bad for you to test.</p>
<p>After you test the code, you reset the good or bad pointer. If the test worked, reset the good pointer, if the test failed, reset the bad pointer.</p>
<p>Git will then check out a new snapshot midway between the new good and bad locations:</p>
<pre>
<strong>    # Pull the current (buggy) code into a git repository</strong>
<strong>    $ git checkout buggyBranch</strong>

<strong>    # Initialize git bisect.</strong>
<strong>    $ git bisect start</strong>

<strong>    # Mark the current commit as bad</strong>
<strong>    $ git bisect bad</strong>

<strong>    # Mark the last known good release tag</strong>
<strong>    # Git pulls a commit at the midpoint for testing.</strong>

<strong>    $ git bisect good v2.5</strong>
<strong>    Bisecting: 3 revisions left to test after this (roughly 2 steps)</strong>

<strong>    # Compile and test</strong>
<strong>    # Mark as good or bad</strong>
<strong>    # Git pulls next commit to test</strong>
<strong>    $ git bisect good</strong>
<strong>    Bisecting: 1 revision left to test after this (roughly 1 step)</strong>

<p>The <kbd>git bisect</kbd> command identifies the version of your code midway between a known good and known bad version. You can now build and test that version. After testing, rerun <kbd>git bisect</kbd> to declare that branch as good or bad. After the branch is declared, <kbd>git bisect</kbd> will identify a new version, halfway between the new good and bad markers.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Tagging snapshots</h1>
            

            
                
<p>Git supports tagging specific snapshots with a mnemonic string and an additional message. You can use the tags to make the development tree clearer with information such as <em>Merged in new memory management</em> or to mark specific snapshots along a branch. For example, you can use a tag to mark <strong>release-1.0</strong> and <strong>release-1.1</strong> along the <strong>release-1</strong> branch.</p>
<p>Git supports both lightweight tags (just tagging a snapshot) and tags with associated annotation.</p>
<p>Git tags are local only. <kbd>git push</kbd> will not push your tags by default. To send tags to the origin repository, you must include the -tags option:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git push origin --tags</strong>
</pre>
<p>The <kbd>git tag</kbd> command has options to add, delete, and list tags.</p>

<p>The <kbd>git tag</kbd> command with no argument will list the visible tags:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git tag</strong>
<strong>    release-1.0</strong>
<strong>    release-1.0beta</strong>
<strong>    release-1.1</strong>
</pre>
<p>You can create a tag on your current checkout by adding a tag name:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ git tag ReleaseCandidate-1</strong>
</pre>
<p>You can add a tag to a previous commit by appending an SHA-1 identifier to the git tag command:</p>

<p>The fossil application is another distributed version control system. Like Git, it maintains a record of changes regardless of whether the developer has access to the master repository site. Unlike Git, fossil supports an auto-sync mode that will automatically push commits to the remote repository if it's accessible. If the remote site is not available at commit time, fossil saves the changes until the remote site becomes available.</p>
<p>Fossil differs from Git in several respects. The fossil repository is implemented in a single SQLite database instead of a set of folders as Git is implemented. The fossil application includes several other tools such as a web interface, a trouble-ticket system, and a wiki, while Git uses add-on applications to provide these services.</p>
<p>Like Git, the main interface to fossil is the <kbd>fossil</kbd> command with subcommands to perform specific actions like creating a new repository, cloning an existing repository, adding, committing files, and so on.</p>
<p>Fossil includes a help facility. The fossil help command will generate a list of supported commands, and <kbd>fossil help CMDNAME</kbd> will display a help page:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil help</strong>
<strong>    Usage: fossil help COMMAND</strong>
<strong>    Common COMMANDs:  (use "fossil help -a|-all" for a complete list)</strong>
<strong>    add        cat        finfo      mv         revert     timeline   </strong>

    <strong>$ fossil new myProject.fossil</strong>
<strong>    project-id: 855b0e1457da519d811442d81290b93bdc0869e2</strong>

<p>The <kbd>fossil init</kbd> and fossil new commands are the same. They create a new empty repository database with the name you request. The <kbd>.fossil</kbd> suffix is not required, but it's a common convention.</p>

<p>The fossil web server provides either local or remote access to many features of the fossil system including configuration, trouble ticket management, a wiki, graphs of the commit history, and more.</p>
<p>The <kbd>fossil ui</kbd> command starts an http server and attempts to connect your local browser to the fossil server. By default, this interface connects you to the UI and you can perform any required task.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Making a repository available to remote users</h1>
            

            
                
<p>The fossil server command starts a fossil server that allows a remote user to clone your repository. By default, fossil allows anyone to clone a project. Disable the checkin, checkout, clone, and download zip capabilities on the <kbd>Admin/Users/Nobody</kbd> and <kbd>Admin/Users/Anonymous</kbd> pages to restrict access to only registered users.</p>
<p>The web interface for configuration is supported when running fossil server, but instead of being the default, you must log in using the credentials provided when you created the repository.</p>
<p>The fossil server can be started with a full path to the repository:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil server /home/projects/projectOne.fossil</strong>
</pre>
<p>The fossil server can be started from a folder with the fossil repository without defining the repository:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ cd /home/projects</strong>
<strong>    $ ls</strong>
<strong>    projectOne.fossil</strong>
   
<strong>    $ fossil server</strong>
<strong>    Listening for HTTP requests on TCP port 8080</strong>
</pre>

<p>Because the fossil repository is contained in a single file, you can clone it simply by copying that file. You can send a fossil repository to another developer as an e-mail attachment, put it on a website, or copy it to a USB memory stick.</p>
<p>The fossil scrub command removes user and password information that the web server may require from the database. This step is recommended before you distribute copies of your repository.</p>

<p>You can clone fossil from a site running fossil in the server mode with the fossil clone command. The fossil clone command distributes the version history, but not the users and password information:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil clone http://RemoteSite:port projectName.fossil</strong>
</pre>

<p>The fossil clone command copies the repository from the site you've specified to a local file with a name you provide (in the example: <kbd>projectName.fossil</kbd>).</p>

<p>The fossil open command extracts the files from a repository. It's usually simplest to create a subfolder under the folder with the fossil repository to hold the project.</p>

</pre>
<p>Make a new folder for your working directory and change to it:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ mkdir newFeature</strong>
<strong>    $ cd newFeature</strong>
</pre>
<p>Open the repository in your working folder:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil open ../project.fossil</strong>
</pre>

<p>You can use fossil open to extract specific revisions of the code in the repository. This example shows how to check out the 1.0 release to fix an old bug. Make a new folder for your working directory and change it as follows:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ mkdir fix_1.0_Bug</strong>
<strong>    $ cd fix_1.0_Bug</strong>
</pre>
<p>Open the repository in your working folder:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil open ../project.fossil release_1.0</strong>
</pre>

<p>Once you've created a repository, you want to add and edit files. The fossil add command adds a new file to a repository and the fossil commit command commits changes to the repository. This is different from Git in which the <kbd>add</kbd> command marks changes to be added and the commit command actually does the commit.</p>

<p>The next examples show how fossil behaves if you have not defined the <kbd>EDITOR</kbd> or <kbd>VISUAL</kbd> shell variables. If <kbd>EDITOR</kbd> or <kbd>VISUAL</kbd> are defined, fossil will use that editor instead of prompting you on the command line:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ echo "example" &gt;example.txt</strong>
<strong>    $ fossil add example.txt</strong>
<strong>    ADDED  example.txt</strong>

<strong>    $ fossil commit</strong>
<strong>    # Enter a commit message for this check-in. Lines beginning with #

<strong>    #</strong>
<strong>    # user: clif</strong>

<p>When you edit a file you only need to commit. By default, the commit will remember all your changes to the local repository. If auto-sync is enabled, the commit will also be pushed to the remote repository:</p>
<pre>

<strong>    $ vim otherExample.txt</strong>
<strong>    $ fossil commit</strong>
<strong>    # Enter a commit message for this check-in. Lines beginning with #

                <h1 class="header-title">Using branches and forks with fossil</h1>
            

            
                
<p>In an ideal world, a development tree is a straight line with one revision following directly from the previous. In reality, developers frequently work from a stable code base and make changes that are then merged back into the mainline development.</p>
<p>The fossil system distinguishes temporary divergences from the mainline code (for example, a bug fix in your repository) from permanent divergences (like the 1.x release that gets only bug fixes, while new features go into 2.x).</p>
<p>The convention in fossil is to refer to intentional divergences as branches and unintentional divergences as forks. For example, you might create a branch for a new code you are developing, while trying to commit a change to a file after someone else has committed a change to that file would cause a fork unless you first update and resolve collisions.</p>
<p>Branches can be temporary or permanent. A temporary branch might be one you create while developing a new feature. A permanent branch is when you make a release that is intended to diverge from the mainline code.</p>
<p>Both temporary and permanent branches are managed with tags and properties.</p>
<p>When you create a fossil repository with fossil <kbd>init</kbd> or fossil new, it assigns the tag <kbd>trunk</kbd> to the tree.</p>
<p>The fossil branch command manages branches. There are subcommands to create new branches, list branches, and close branches.</p>

<ol>
<li>The first step in working with branches is to create one. The fossil branch new command creates a new branch. It can either create a branch based on your current checkout of the project, or you can create a branch at an earlier state of the project.</li>
<li>The fossil branch new command will create a new branch from a given checkin:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
        <strong>$ fossil branch new NewBranchName Basis-Id</strong>
<strong>        New branch: 9ae25e77317e509e420a51ffbc43c2b1ae4034da</strong>
</pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>The <kbd>Basis-Id</kbd> is an identifier to tell fossil what code snapshot to branch from. There are several ways to define the <kbd>Basis-Id</kbd>. The most common of these are discussed in the next section.</li>
<li>Note that you need to perform a checkout to update your working folder to the new branch:</li>

<p><kbd>NewBranchName</kbd> is the name for your new branch. A convention is to name branches in a way that describes the modification being made. Branch names such as <kbd>localtime_fixes</kbd> or <kbd>bug_1234_fix</kbd> are common.</p>
<p>The <kbd>Basis-Id</kbd> is a string that identifies the node where the branch diverges. This can be the name of a branch if you are diverging from the head of a given branch.</p>
<p>The following commands show how to create a branch from the tip of a trunk:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil branch new test_rework_parse_logic trunk</strong>
<strong>    New branch: 9ae25e77317e509e420a51ffbc43c2b1ae4034da</strong>

<strong>    $ fossil checkout test_rework_parse_logic </strong>
</pre>
<p>The fossil commit command allows you to specify a new branch name at commit time with the <kbd>--branch</kbd> option:</p>

    <strong>$ fossil checkout trunk</strong>

<strong>    # Make Changes</strong>

<strong>    $ fossil commit --branch test_rework_parse_logic</strong>

<p>Branches and forks can both be merged back into their parent branch. The forks are considered temporary and should be merged as soon as the modifications are approved. Branches are considered permanent, but even these may be merged back into the mainline code.</p>
<p>The fossil merge command will merge a temporary fork into another branch.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Now you can edit and test. When you're satisfied with the new code, commit the new code onto a new branch. The <kbd>--branch</kbd> option creates a new branch if necessary and sets your current branch to the new <kbd>branch</kbd>:</li>

<p>The flip side of pushing your work to the remote repository is updating your local repository. You'll need to do this if you do some development on your laptop while the main repository is on your companies server, or if you are working on a project with multiple people and you need to keep up to date on their new features.</p>

<p>The fossil server does not push updates to remote repositories automatically. The <kbd>fossil pull</kbd> command will pull updates to your repository. It updates the repository, but does not change your working code:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil pull</strong>
</pre>
<p>The <kbd>fossil checkout</kbd> command will update your working code if there were changes in the repository:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil checkout</strong>
</pre>
<p>You can combine the pull and checkout subcommands with the <kbd>fossil update</kbd> command:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil update</strong>
<strong>    UPDATE main.tcl</strong>

<p>Before you start any new development, you should compare the state of your local repository to the master repository. You don't want to waste time writing code that conflicts with code that's been accepted.</p>

<p>The <kbd>fossil status</kbd> command will report the current status of your project, whether you have uncommitted edits and whether your working code is at the tip:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil status</strong>
<strong>    repository:   /home/clif/myProject/../myProject.fossil</strong>
<strong>    local-root:   /home/clif/myProject/</strong>

</pre>
<p>If there has been a commit made to the branch you're working on since your last checkout, the status will include a line resembling the following:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>child:         abcdef123456789...  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM::SS UTC</strong>
</pre>
<p>This indicates that there is a commit after your code. You will have to do a <kbd>fossil update</kbd> to bring your working copy of the code into sync before you can commit to the head of the branch. This may require you to fix conflicts by hand.</p>
<p>Note that fossil can only report the data in your local repository. If commits have been made but not pushed to the server and pulled into your local repository, they won't be displayed. You should invoke <kbd>fossil sync</kbd> before <kbd>fossil status</kbd> to confirm that your repository has all the latest information.</p>

<p>The <kbd>fossil server</kbd> and <kbd>fossil ui</kbd> commands start fossil's web server and let you view the history of check-ins and navigate through code via your favorite browser.</p>
<p>The timeline tab provides a tree-structured view of the branches, commits, and merges. The web interface supports viewing the source code associated with the commits and performing diffs between different versions.</p>

<p>The <kbd>fossil diff</kbd> command has several options. When looking for the code that introduced a problem, we generally want to perform a diff on two versions of a file. The <kbd>-from</kbd> and <kbd>-to</kbd> options to <kbd>fossil diff</kbd> perform this action:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil diff -from ID-1 -to ID-2FILENAME</strong>
</pre>
<p><kbd>ID-1</kbd> and <kbd>ID-2</kbd> are identifiers used in the repository. They may be SHA-1 hashes, tags or dates, and so on. The <kbd>FILENAME</kbd> is the file that was committed to fossil.</p>
<p>For example, to find the difference between two revisions of <kbd>main.tcl</kbd> use the following command:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil diff -from 47c85 -to 7a7e25 main.tcl</strong>

<p>The differences between two revisions are useful, but it's more useful to see the entire file annotated to show when lines were added.</p>
<p>The <kbd>fossil blame</kbd> command generates an annotated listing of a file showing when lines were added:</p>

<p>When you know that there's a problem in one version but not in another, you need to center in on the version where the problem was introduced.</p>
<p>The <kbd>fossil bisect</kbd> command provides support for this. It lets you define a good and bad version of the code and automatically checks out the version between those to be tested. You can then mark this version as good or bad and fossil will repeat the process. Fossil bisect also generates reports showing how many versions have been tested and how many need to be tested.</p>
<p>How to do it...</p>
<p>The <kbd>fossil bisect reset</kbd> command initializes the good and bad pointers. The <kbd>fossil bisect good</kbd> and <kbd>fossil bisect bad</kbd> commands mark versions as good or bad and check out the version of the code that's midway between the good and bad version:</p>
<pre>
<strong>$ fossil bisect reset</strong>
<strong>$ fossil bisect good 63e1e1</strong>
<strong>$ fossil bisect bad 47c85d</strong>

<p>Every node in the fossil graph can have one or more tags attached to it. Tags can identify releases, branches, or just particular milestones that you may want to refer to. For example, you may want a release-1 branch with tags for release-1.0, release-1.1, and so on. A tag can be used with checkout or merge instead of using the SHA1 identifier.</p>
<p>Tags are implemented with the fossil tag command. Fossil supports several subcommands to add, cancel, find, and list tags.</p>
<p>The <kbd>fossil tag add</kbd> command creates a new tag:</p>
<pre>
    <strong>$ fossil tag add TagName Identifier</strong>
</pre>

<p>The <kbd>TagName</kbd> is whatever you want to call the branch.</p>
<p>Identifier is an identifier for the node to be tagged. The identifier can be one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A branch name</strong>: Tag the most recent commit on this branch</li>
<li><strong>An SHA1 identifier</strong>: Tag the commit with this SHA1 identifier</li>
<li><strong>A datestamp (YYYY-MM-DD)</strong>: Tag the commit just previous to this datestamp</li>
<li><strong>A timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)</strong>: Tag the commit just previous to this timestamp</li>
</ol>
<pre>
<strong>        # Tag the current tip of the trunk as release_1.0
