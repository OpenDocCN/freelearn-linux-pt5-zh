- en: SELinux can be seen as a daunting beast to tame. For many, it is considered
    to be a complex security system on the already versatile environment that Linux
    can be. But as with most IT-related services, it is the unfamiliarity with the
    technology that is causing the notion of having a complicated system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is, however, nothing like that. SELinux is not all that difficult to understand.
    If it were, then Linux distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux wouldn't
    enable it by default.

- en: To support everyone in their daily operations with SELinux-enabled systems,
    this book came to life. It contains numerous chapters on the various aspects of
    SELinux handling and policy development in a recipe-based approach that allows
    every person to quickly dive into the details and challenges that making a system
    more secure brings forth.

    For that, I have written another better-suited SELinux resource, *SELinux System
    Administration*, *Packt Publishing*, which covers the system administration tasks
    of SELinux-enabled systems, such as dealing with SELinux Booleans and file context
    changes as well as an introduction to the SELinux technology.

- en: This book is also not a reference for the SELinux policy language in all its
    glory. Although the most common statements will be mentioned and used several
    times, it should be noted that the SELinux policy language and its internal architecture
    has a much wider scope. For a good language and component reference, *The SELinux
    Notebook – The Foundations*, *Richard Haines*, is recommended. This resource is
    available online at [http://www.freetechbooks.com/the-selinux-notebook-the-foundations-t785.html](http://www.freetechbooks.com/the-selinux-notebook-the-foundations-t785.html).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. The SELinux Development Environment"), *The
    SELinux Development Environment*, tells us how to set up the SELinux policy development
    environment through which further policy development can occur. We will look into
    a structured, reusable method for SELinux policy development and will create our
    first set of SELinux policy modules that are nicely integrated with the existing
    SELinux policies.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Dealing with File Labels"), *Dealing with
    File Labels*, focuses on how file labels are set and managed. We will learn how
    to configure the SELinux policy ourselves as well as how to use and declare file
    contexts and assign the right context to the right type of resource.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Confining Web Applications"), *Confining
    Web Applications*, covers the default confinement of the web server SELinux domain
    and explains how to enhance the existing policy to suit our needs. Additional
    SELinux support through the mod_selinux Apache module is also covered.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Creating a Desktop Application Policy"),
    *Creating a Desktop Application Policy*, is the first chapter where an entirely
    new application domain and policy is written. We will look at how the policy needs
    to be structured and the policy rules that are needed in order to successfully
    and securely run the application.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Creating a Server Policy"), *Creating a Server
    Policy*, follows the previous chapter''s momentum but now with a focus on server
    services. This chapter targets the differences between desktop application policies
    and server policies, and we will develop a fully functioning SELinux policy module
    together with the necessary administrative policy interfaces needed to integrate
    the policy in a larger SELinux environment.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Setting Up Separate Roles"), *Setting Up
    Separate Roles*, looks into the role-based access controls that SELinux offers.
    We create our own set of roles with the least privilege principle in mind. After
    considering the definition of SELinux users and roles, we then practice the management
    of these roles in larger environments.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Choosing the Confinement Level"), *Choosing
    the Confinement Level*, inspects the different confinement levels that policies
    can use and how these are implemented on the system. We learn about the pros and
    cons of each confinement level and create our own policy set that provides the
    different levels.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Debugging SELinux"), *Debugging SELinux*,
    scrutinizes the various methods available to debug SELinux behavior and policies.
    We acquire the necessary skills to work with the Linux auditing subsystem to generate
    additional logging and perform advanced queries against the SELinux policy. In
    this chapter, we also uncover why certain popular Linux debugging tools do not
    (properly) work on an SELinux-enabled system.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Aligning SELinux with DAC"), *Aligning SELinux
    with DAC*, examines how SELinux can be used to enhance the existing Linux DAC
    restrictions. We deal with the various technologies available and how the SELinux
    policy can be augmented to work properly with those technologies.'

    *Handling SELinux-aware Applications*, considers the SELinux-aware applications
    and the interaction (and debugging difficulties) they have with the system and
    SELinux in general. We learn how to configure these applications'' SELinux integration
    and how to debug the applications when things go wrong. This chapter also describes
    how to create our own SELinux-aware application.'

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the book focuses on hands-on experience, it is seriously recommended to have
    an SELinux-enabled system at your disposal. Many distributions offer live environments
    that can be used to perform initial investigations with, but ensure that you pick
    one that can persist the changes made to the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An SELinux-enabled system should be using a recent set of SELinux libraries
    and user space utilities. This book is written based on Gentoo Hardened, running
    the SELinux user space libraries and utilities released in October 2013 (such
    as libselinux-2.2.2) with the reference policy released in March 2014\. The distribution
    itself is not that important, as everything in this book is distribution-independent,
    so it is well usable for Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, although the latter—at
    the time of writing, Version 6—is still using older versions of the SELinux user
    space libraries and utilities.

- en: From an experience point of view, you should be well-versed in Linux system
    administration as SELinux policy development and integration requires good knowledge
    of the components that we are about to confine and protect. This book assumes
    that you are familiar with the Git version control system as an end user. This
    book also assumes basic knowledge of how SELinux works on a system.
