James Bond is the secret agent who most likely comes to mind, but in today's highly connected world, the real secret agents are to be found in Q branch. Spycraft techniques such as camouflage, listening devices, and palm-print weapons are useful for field agents, but online we need other tools. These tools, like their field agent counterparts, enable you to hide in a crowd, protect secret communication, and prove the identity of other agents. The software and hardware projects in this book use tools relied upon by whistleblowers, journalists protecting their sources, and everyday citizens attempting to access unfiltered information in a strongly censored country.</p><p class="calibre7">
<strong class="calibre8">BeagleBone Black</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">BBB</strong>) is a complete computer that fits inside an Altoid's tin. Its small form factor, low power consumption, and capable performance empower the device to help you secure your privacy and protect your communication online. Before we can build upon these tools, we first need to know how to interact with the BBB. This chapter will introduce you to BBB and suggest a development environment in which you can build the later projects.</p><p class="calibre7">In this chapter, you will:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Learn about BBB and the open source principles behind the project</li><li class="listitem">Install and use the Emacs editor</li><li class="listitem">Configure Emacs as your embedded development environment</li><li class="listitem">Tailor your SSH configuration for usability</li><li class="listitem">Investigate resources for background information on cryptography, electronics, and Linux</li></ul></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09" class="calibre1"/>Introducing the BBB</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">From<a id="id0" class="calibre1"/> the BeagleBoard website (<a class="calibre1" href="http://BeagleBoard.org">BeagleBoard.org</a> ), which is the nonprofit<a id="id1" class="calibre1"/> foundation behind BeagleBoard-xM, BeagleBone, and BBB, the BBB is <em class="calibre9">a low-cost, community-supported development platform for developers and hobbyists</em>. The Rev C, which is the latest revision, has impressive specifications including the TI Sitara AM3358 1GHz ARM Cortex-A8 processor, 512 MB of DDR3 RAM, and 4 GB <strong class="calibre8">Embedded Multi-Media Card</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">eMMC</strong>) <a id="id2" class="calibre1"/>for on-board flash. When you take a look at the board, you'll see two 46-pin expansions headers. If you compare it to other hobbyist boards around the same price point, you'll come to the conclusion that the other boards do not contain nearly as much expansion capability. The BBB<a id="id3" class="calibre1"/> supports many more <strong class="calibre8">Input/Output</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">IO</strong>) options, including <a id="id4" class="calibre1"/>three I2C buses, multiple serial ports, 65 <strong class="calibre8">General Purpose IO</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">GPIO</strong>), multiple <strong class="calibre8">Pulse Width Modulators</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">PWM</strong>), and seven analog<a id="id5" class="calibre1"/> inputs with built-in <strong class="calibre8">Analog-to-Digital Converters</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">ADCs</strong>). If you <a id="id6" class="calibre1"/>don't know what all of these are, that's not a problem, as we'll explain the systems that we use throughout the projects.</p><p class="calibre7">The quality of the documentation from <a class="calibre1" href="http://BeagleBoard.org">BeagleBoard.org</a> is outstanding. You should read<a id="id7" class="calibre1"/> the BBB <strong class="calibre8">System Reference Manual</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">SRM</strong>), the official manual for BBB, which is located at <a class="calibre1" href="https://github.com/CircuitCo/BeagleBone-Black/blob/master/BBB_SRM.pdf?raw=true">https://github.com/CircuitCo/BeagleBone-Black/blob/master/BBB_SRM.pdf?raw=true</a>. This is a complete manual that covers connecting the BBB, power options, and boot sequences. Many of the questions asked on the BeagleBoard mailing list and IRC channel can be quickly answered in this manual. The author of this book assumes that you've at least skimmed sections 3, 4, and 5 of the SRM, which means you are aware of the basic capabilities of BBB and are familiar with the physical connectors. There is simply no better reference for the BBB than this document.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07" class="calibre1"/>Appreciating BBB's commitment to open source hardware</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">BBB has another very important quality: it is <strong class="calibre8">Open Source Hardware</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">OSHW</strong>). OSHW is a relatively new concept, the exact definition<a id="id8" class="calibre1"/> of which may confuse people. However, there is a group, the <strong class="calibre8">OSHW Association</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">OSHWA</strong>), whose mission is to <a id="id9" class="calibre1"/> educate and promote OSHW. Their <a id="id10" class="calibre1"/>definition is maintained on their website: <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.oshwa.org/definition/">http://www.oshwa.org/definition/</a>. As with most organizations, a consensus for a definition <a id="id11" class="calibre1"/>can be difficult to obtain. The definition of OSHW is well over a page. The complication with defining OSHW from open source software is that hardware is a <em class="calibre9">physical thing</em>. There are design files to manufacture hardware, but there are physical components also. To make a software analogy, the compiler for the hardware is the manufacturer. Therefore, the definition of OSHW is carefully constructed and it generally applies to the design files of the hardware.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note02" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">Alicia Gibb, the Executive Director of OSHWA, gave a TEDx talk called <em class="calibre9">The Death of Patents and What Comes After</em> (<a class="calibre1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z__Sbw1Ax4o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z__Sbw1Ax4o</a>). The talk illustrates how hardware design straddles both copyrights and patent law. Alicia also provides some interesting insights on the incentives behind patents and OSHW.</p></div><p class="calibre7">BBB is<a id="id12" class="calibre1"/> OSHW, in that it releases documentation, schematics, <strong class="calibre8">Computer-Aided Design</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">CAD</strong>) files, <strong class="calibre8">Bill Of Materials</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">BOM</strong>), and <a id="id13" class="calibre1"/>production files (Gerbers), all <a id="id14" class="calibre1"/>under a Creative Commons license. This <a id="id15" class="calibre1"/>means that you can not only study the complete design but you are also free to make your own derivative BBB.</p></div></div></div>

A recent BBB<a id="id17" class="calibre1"/> will come with the Debian distribution of GNU/Linux, henceforth referred to as Debian, installed on the eMMC. eMMC is the on-board flash memory for the BBB. As soon as power is applied to the board, BBB will start to boot from the eMMC. As shown in section three of the SRM, you can connect the BBB directly to your PC with the supplied USB cable. The BBB can also be powered from a 5V barrel jack, where you'll want a wall adapter that can supply up to 1A. If you plan on connecting<a id="id18" class="calibre1"/> a mini <strong class="calibre8">liquid-crystal display</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">LCD</strong>) to the BBB, you may want to use a 2A adapter. You can typically find the output voltage and amperage specifications written on the adapter. You can tell whether the board is <a id="id19" class="calibre1"/>powered and running if the blue user <strong class="calibre8">light-emitting diodes</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">LEDs</strong>) are flashing. Specifically, the LED USER0 will flash in a heartbeat pattern.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note03" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">Each user LED has a default meaning that corresponds to a specific BBB activity. To further motivate you to read the SRM, the meanings are defined in section 3.4.3 under step 6, <em class="calibre9">Booting the Board</em>.</p></div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip02" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">Be very careful when choosing your power supply. The BBB needs 5VDC +/-.25V. Connecting a higher voltage power supply will damage the board.</p></div><p class="calibre7">The BBB can support multiple peripherals such as a keyboard, mouse, and monitor. However, in this book, we'll be using the BBB in a <em class="calibre9">headless </em>configuration, which means <em class="calibre9">without</em> the monitor. Section 3 of the SRM details the various connection scenarios.</p></div></div></div>

We need a set of tools that will connect to the BBB, send shell commands, and transfer files. This set of tools are your <strong class="calibre8">development environment</strong>. Development environments are a personal choice and there is no shortage of choices. Finding a suitable environment is well worth the time since it will be the main tool, or tools, with which you interface. Your environment needs to be technically capable of performing the tasks you need, but it also needs to be configurable and extensible. The environment that is described here is fully contained within the Emacs editor.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note04" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">If you would rather use a specific <strong class="calibre8">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">IDE</strong>) such<a id="id22" class="calibre1"/> as Eclipse, you can take a look at some useful tutorials at <a class="calibre1" href="http://derekmolloy.ie/beaglebone/setting-up-eclipse-on-the-beaglebone-for-c-development/">http://derekmolloy.ie/beaglebone/setting-up-eclipse-on-the-beaglebone-for-c-development/</a> and <a class="calibre1" href="http://janaxelson.com/eclipse1.htm">http://janaxelson.com/eclipse1.htm</a>.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09" class="calibre1"/>Understanding the complications of embedded development</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">The <a id="id23" class="calibre1"/>history of Emacs is about as long as the history of modern computing. As an editor, Emacs is often overlooked because of its reputation of being outdated and difficult to learn. Emacs can be overwhelming since the interface is different from most modern interfaces. Also, the keybindings were created prior to the invention of modern <strong class="calibre8">Graphical User Interfaces</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">GUIs</strong>), so <a id="id24" class="calibre1"/>the keybindings don't correspond to the shortcuts that you are typically accustomed to. However, there is active development on various Emacs <em class="calibre9">starter packs</em>, which provide a smoother Emacs experience. If you keep in mind that Emacs predates your operating system, you may find it easier to accept the Emacs way.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note05" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">Many early notable programmers have worked on Emacs, including Guy Steele, Richard Stallman, James Gosling, and Jamie Zawinski. The design of Emacs was presented by Richard Stallman in 1981 to the ACM Conference on Text Processing; the full text is available at <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html</a>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">Embedded development is slightly more complicated than web or desktop development because there are typically two machines involved: the host (your main computer) and the target (your embedded platform). Embedded systems range in capabilities and some run without an operating system, which certainly can't support running a compiler. In this case, the user cross-compiles the code on the host for the target. This can be performed for the BBB, but compiling small programs natively on the BBB does not take too long.</p><p class="calibre7">A <a id="id25" class="calibre1"/>common recommendation for development on the BBB is to connect to the device over <strong class="calibre8">Secure Shell</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">SSH</strong>) and to use<a id="id26" class="calibre1"/> command-line tools. This can be an effective technique, but this limits you to the command line and your terminal emulator. These tools are very powerful and in this context, limited does not mean limited in functionality but limited in the interface.</p><p class="calibre7">The one helpful feature of Emacs for embedded development is <strong class="calibre8">Transparent Remote Access Multiple Protocol</strong> or the <strong class="calibre8">TRAMP</strong> mode. In short, the TRAMP mode lets you run Emacs on your host machine, which is most likely more powerful than the BBB, but access files and run commands on the BBB as if they were local. This is transparent in TRAMP; working in this environment feels like you are working on a host, not on an embedded platform. The following screenshot shows the TRAMP feature of Emacs:</p><div><img src="img/00002.jpeg" alt="Understanding the complications of embedded development" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">This screenshot was captured with Emacs running on Mac OS X, but connected to a BBB with the hostname <code class="email">slartibartfast</code>. Everything on this screen is running on the BBB. In the top-left corner, the frame shows a live debugging session with the <strong class="calibre8">GNU debugger</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">GDB</strong>) on a <a id="id27" class="calibre1"/>simple C program. In the bottom-left corner, the frame <a id="id28" class="calibre1"/>shows the compilation result obtained from running <code class="email">gcc</code> on the BBB. In the top-right corner, the frame shows the interactive <code class="email">gdb</code> session. Lastly, in the bottom-right corner, the frames show the current directory and a shell, respectively. In the following sections, we'll provide details on how to install Emacs and set up this development environment.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip03" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">To name your BBB, you'll have to change two files. The first file is <code class="email">/etc/hostname</code> and then you'll have to make the same change in <code class="email">/etc/hosts</code>.

Here's a tongue-in-cheek joke: <em class="calibre9">Emacs is an operating system that is in need of a good editor</em>. This <a id="id39" class="calibre1"/>section will illustrate the basic skills that one needs to use Emacs and more importantly, to learn how to use Emacs. One of the best features of Emacs is the immense built-in help. If you have never run Emacs before, press <em class="calibre9">Ctrl-h t</em>, abbreviated <em class="calibre9">C-h t</em>. This means that while holding the <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> key, press <em class="calibre9">h</em>, then release it, and then press <em class="calibre9">t</em>. Also, note that the Emacs commands are case sensitive. <em class="calibre9">C-H T </em>means to press <em class="calibre9">Ctrl + Shift + H</em>, then hit <em class="calibre9">Shift + T</em>, whereas <em class="calibre9">C-h t</em> is performed without the shift modifier. You'll be presented with the interactive Emacs tutorial. This tutorial will teach you the fundamentals of Emacs. In the tutorial, you'll see references to a meta key, which you will be hard pressed to find on your keyboard. Command sequences, such as <em class="calibre9">M-x</em>, mean to hold down the meta key while pressing <em class="calibre9">x</em>. Depending on your system, the meta key may be <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> or <em class="calibre9">Option</em>. If neither of these work, you can press the <em class="calibre9">Esc</em> key and release it to provide meta.</p><p class="calibre7">The tutorial is very good and for the rest of this chapter, it is assumed that you have completed this tutorial or have an equivalent level of knowledge to understand the more advanced <a id="id40" class="calibre1"/>features.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note07" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">Some other helpful resources to learn Emacs are Sacha Chua's <em class="calibre9">How to Learn Emacs</em> diagram (<a class="calibre1" href="http://sachachua.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/How-to-Learn-Emacs-v2-Large.png">http://sachachua.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/How-to-Learn-Emacs-v2-Large.png</a>) and the official <em class="calibre9">Emacs 24 Reference Card</em> (<a class="calibre1" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf">https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf</a>).</p></div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip05" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">If you are a vi user, there is a mode that emulates most vi keybindings, called the viper <a id="id41" class="calibre1"/>mode (<a class="calibre1" href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ViperMode">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ViperMode</a>).</p></div></div></div>

If you run the BBB from the USB cable attached to your PC, then the default Internet Protocol (IP) address of the BBB will be <code class="email">192.168.7.2</code>. However, if you want to download software directly to the BBB, as you will need to do in order to complete these projects, you'll have to forward your Internet connection from the PC to the BBB. Also, when powered from the USB directly, there is typically a 500mA current limit. When the BBB is powering expansion boards or other peripherals, it'll need to be powered from a 5V DC plug that can supply up to 1A. As a result of these two issues, you may find it much more convenient to run the BBB from a 5V power supply and connect the Ethernet cable into your home network directly.</p><p class="calibre7">When you do this, the IP address will most likely be assigned by your router and will only be known to your router.

You can attach the USB-to-serial adapter to BBB's serial debug header, as shown in the following image:</p><div><img src="img/00004.jpeg" alt="Discovering the IP address of your networked BBB" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">In this figure, pin 1 (which is the black wire) is the ground, pin 4 is receive, and pin 5 is transmit.

The lease on this request can be indefinite <a id="id55" class="calibre1"/>and, therefore, effectively provides a <em class="calibre9">static</em> IP. You can also set the IP statically on your device, but then you will have to manage conflicts manually.

</pre></div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip08" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">If you are a Windows user, you should consider using more Unixy tools on your host since the<a id="id59" class="calibre1"/> BBB is running Debian anyway. You can install Cygwin (<a class="calibre1" href="https://www.cygwin.com/">https://www.cygwin.com/</a>), which will give you a nice shell with<a id="id60" class="calibre1"/> the associated command-line tools. Or, consider downloading VirtualBox (<a class="calibre1" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a>) and installing a GNU/Linux distribution in a virtual machine.</p></div><p class="calibre7">The default username is <code class="email">debian</code> and the default password is <code class="email">temppwd</code>. If you only have one device, typing this command may be manageable. Once you start collecting BBBs, Raspberry Pis, pcDuinos, Cubieboards, Arduinos with a WiFly Shield, and so on, you will have to remember each IP, username, and password. This can become annoying. Fortunately, there are a few tricks that you can use to improve this situation.</p><p class="calibre7">First, you'll need a SSH private key. If you don't already have a key, you can generate one on your host with the following command:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre8">ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Now edit the <code class="email">~/.ssh/config</code> file. If you are doing this in Emacs, you can press <em class="calibre9">C-x C-f</em> and then type <code class="email">~/.ssh/config</code>. Emacs keybindings are all bound to Emacs Lisp commands (technically, there are a few basic commands implemented in C). The keybinding <em class="calibre9">C-x C-f</em> is bound to the <code class="email">find-file</code> function. An alternate, albeit longer, way to open a file is to press <em class="calibre9">M-x</em>, type <code class="email">find-file</code>, then open the file of your choice.</p><p class="calibre7">Add the following section to your <code class="email">~/.ssh/config</code> file, replacing HostName with the IP address of your BBB:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre8">Host bbb</strong>
<strong class="calibre8">     HostName 192.168.1.10</strong>
<strong class="calibre8">     User debian</strong>
</pre></div><pre>http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-regenerate-openssh-host-keys/</a>:</pre><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre8">rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*</strong>
<strong class="calibre8">dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">This will delete your existing SSH host key and regenerate it from scratch. Since the host key has changed, we need to update your SSH client on you main computer. If you log in to the BBB again, you will probably receive a warning that the fingerprint doesn't match because you changed it. You can remove the old entry from your client by typing the following (you may have to use the IP address instead of <code class="email">bbb</code>):</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre8">ssh-keygen -R bbb</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Alternatively, you can edit <code class="email">~/.ssh/known_hosts</code> directly and remove the entry.</p><p class="calibre7">With the new SSH key on the BBB and the old entry in <code class="email">known_hosts</code> removed, log back in to the BBB just to make sure everything is working. Log back out and return to the terminal on your host. After executing the following command, you will no longer be prompted for a password:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre8">cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh bbb 'cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys'</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">This will copy your public SSH key to the BBB, which will be recognized in the SSH handshake as an authorized key, and therefore, it will not require you to enter the <code class="email">debian</code> user's password.</p><p class="calibre7">Most likely, you will need to perform this operation again and you may not want to refer to this book to find this command. You can add this function to your <code class="email">.bashrc</code> file or an equivalent for further ease of use:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">ssh_upload(){
  if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then
    echo "usage: host\nNOTE: host should be set in ~/.ssh/config"
    else
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh $1 'cat &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
    fi
}</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Then, you<a id="id66" class="calibre1"/> can add your key to servers<a id="id67" class="calibre1"/> with:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre8">ssh_upload bbb</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Don't forget to reload your <code class="email">.bashrc</code> file to gain this function with:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">source ~/.bashrc</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Logging out and in again will also work.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch01lvl3sec04" class="calibre1"/>Running an SSH agent to control access to your SSH keys</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Now <a id="id68" class="calibre1"/>you don't have to enter the <code class="email">debian</code> account password each time you log in to the BBB, but now<a id="id69" class="calibre1"/> you do have to enter the password for your SSH private key. This is equally annoying. However, we can fix this by running <code class="email">ssh-agent</code>. Installing and configuring <code class="email">ssh-agent</code> is OS-dependent, and instructions are easy to find online. Once <code class="email">ssh-agent</code> is running, you'll typically have to enter <a id="id70" class="calibre1"/>your SSH<a id="id71" class="calibre1"/> private key password when you log in and if you make an SSH connection within a certain time period, you'll instantly connect to the remote server without any additional password entry.</p></div></div></div>

Emacs has a built-in directory editor called <code class="email">dired</code>, which <a id="id74" class="calibre1"/>can be invoked by pressing <em class="calibre9">C-x d</em>. We want to open <code class="email">dired</code> on the BBB to view the remote files. Press <em class="calibre9">C-x d</em> and then enter the following for the directory: <code class="email">/ssh:bbb:/home/debian</code>.

To evaluate Emacs Lisp, press <em class="calibre9">M-:</em> and then type <code class="email">tramp-default-method</code> and the mini buffer should reply with <code class="email">ssh</code>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">For more information on <code class="email">dired</code> or anything about Emacs, you can view the built-in documentation by pressing <em class="calibre9">C-h r</em>. If you scroll or search (by pressing <em class="calibre9">C-s</em>), you'll find the <code class="email">dired</code> manual on that page. The manual uses the info viewer, and you can read about this by pressing <em class="calibre9">C-h i</em> to get the main information page and then pressing <em class="calibre9">h</em>.</p><p class="calibre7">One of the features of Emacs is its extensibility. Presumably, you will be connecting to the BBB often, pressing <em class="calibre9">C-x d</em>, and typing <code class="email">/ssh:bbb:/home/debian</code> can be tiresome. Let's define a new key sequence to make this easier. Switch to the scratch buffer in Emacs. This can be done by pressing <em class="calibre9">C-x b</em>, then typing <code class="email">*scratch</code>, and then hitting <em class="calibre9">Tab</em> + <em class="calibre9">Enter</em>. Paste the following code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">(global-set-key

   (dired "/ssh:bbb:/home/debian")))</pre></div><pre> press <em class="calibre9">C-x C-y</em> and you should see the home directory of BBB. Congratulations! You've just customized Emacs! If you restart Emacs, however, you'll lose this convenient function, so you need<a id="id76" class="calibre1"/> to save it. If you are using the Emacs prelude, customizations should go in <code class="email">~/.emacs.d/personal/foo.el</code>. You can save this buffer with <em class="calibre9">C-x C-s</em> and specify the filename.</pre><p class="calibre7">If you enjoy using Emacs, you will probably enjoy changing Emacs, which can be done with Emacs Lisp. Of course, Emacs contains a great manual to learn Emacs Lisp, <em class="calibre9">An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp</em>. It can be accessed by pressing <em class="calibre9">C-h i d</em> and then you can either scroll down to the manual or press m, type <code class="email">Emacs Lisp</code>, and then press <em class="calibre9">Tab</em> for tabcompletion to <em class="calibre9">Emacs Lisp Intro</em>.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch01lvl3sec05" class="calibre1"/>Running commands from Emacs</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">If you<a id="id77" class="calibre1"/> are currently looking<a id="id78" class="calibre1"/> at the <code class="email">dired</code> buffer in Emacs, then Emacs is <a id="id79" class="calibre1"/>aware that you are on a remote machine. Certain commands are TRAMP-aware and will execute remotely. For example, <em class="calibre9">M-!</em> will execute a shell command. When used over TRAMP, it will execute the shell command remotely. Try using <em class="calibre9">M-!</em> with <code class="email">touch</code> <code class="email">test.txt</code>. Now press <em class="calibre9">g</em> to refresh <code class="email">dired</code>. You should now see <code class="email">test.txt</code>. If you edit this file by navigating to it in <code class="email">dired</code> and then pressing <em class="calibre9">Enter</em>, you will now be editing the file remotely. Technically, you are editing a local copy of this buffer but when you save it with <em class="calibre9">C-x C-s</em>, it will send the changes over to the BBB.</p><p class="calibre7">There is a benefit to this system. If the SSH connection drops, for whatever reason, the buffer is still in RAM on your local machine. Once the connection is restored, Emacs will save the buffer. Emacs acts as a session manager for your remote connections and will transparently reconnect when needed.</p><p class="calibre7">If you open a C file in Emacs, Emacs will apply C-aware syntax highlighting, but it can also compile and debug over TRAMP. To compile, invoke <em class="calibre9">M-x</em>, type <code class="email">compile</code>, and supply the compile command. If there is a makefile, then <code class="email">make</code> should suffice; otherwise, provide the full <code class="email">gcc</code> compilation string. The benefit of using the compile function is that Emacs will be aware of compilation errors and you can jump to each one with <em class="calibre9">C-x</em>`. Lastly, if you install <code class="email">gdb</code> on BBB, you debug with <code class="email">gdb</code> from your host computer. Assuming that you compiled your program with debug symbols, if you are looking at the source file in the current buffer, you can press <em class="calibre9">M-x</em>, and then type <code class="email">gdb</code>.</p><p class="calibre7">You'll have to provide the <code class="email">gdb</code> command, which is something such as <code class="email">gdb nameofexec -i=mi</code>. Emacs will remotely launch <code class="email">gdb</code> and open an interactive session. If you set breakpoints, Emacs will switch over to the code buffer and show you where the instruction pointer has stopped in the code.</p><p class="calibre7">Lastly, you can run a shell inside Emacs on the remote system as well. If you are in a TRAMP-aware buffer, pressing <em class="calibre9">M-x</em> and then typing <code class="email">shell</code> will open a remote shell. You can perform all your development actions while never leaving Emacs. Emacs can also act as your mail reader, calculator, IRC client, and even play Tetris (by pressing <em class="calibre9">M-x</em>, and then typing <code class="email">Tetris</code>). Emacs is a cross platform editor, so if you learn how to use Emacs once, you can use it as your development environment on any machine.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip10" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">XKCD fans of comic 378, should press <em class="calibre9">M-x</em> and then type <code class="email">butterfly</code>.
