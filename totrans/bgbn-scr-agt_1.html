James Bond is the secret agent who most likely comes to mind, but in today's highly connected world, the real secret agents are to be found in Q branch. Spycraft techniques such as camouflage, listening devices, and palm-print weapons are useful for field agents, but online we need other tools. These tools, like their field agent counterparts, enable you to hide in a crowd, protect secret communication, and prove the identity of other agents. The software and hardware projects in this book use tools relied upon by whistleblowers, journalists protecting their sources, and everyday citizens attempting to access unfiltered information in a strongly censored country.</p><p class="calibre7">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">BeagleBone Black</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">BBB</strong></span>) is a complete computer that fits inside an Altoid's tin. Its small form factor, low power consumption, and capable performance empower the device to help you secure your privacy and protect your communication online. Before we can build upon these tools, we first need to know how to interact with the BBB. This chapter will introduce you to BBB and suggest a development environment in which you can build the later projects.</p><p class="calibre7">In this chapter, you will:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Learn about BBB and the open source principles behind the project</li><li class="listitem">Install and use the Emacs editor</li><li class="listitem">Configure Emacs as your embedded development environment</li><li class="listitem">Tailor your SSH configuration for usability</li><li class="listitem">Investigate resources for background information on cryptography, electronics, and Linux</li></ul></div></div>

The Rev C, which is the latest revision, has impressive specifications including the TI Sitara AM3358 1GHz ARM Cortex-A8 processor, 512 MB of DDR3 RAM, and 4 GB <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Embedded Multi-Media Card</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">eMMC</strong></span>) <a id="id2" class="calibre1"/>for on-board flash. When you take a look at the board, you'll see two 46-pin expansions headers. If you compare it to other hobbyist boards around the same price point, you'll come to the conclusion that the other boards do not contain nearly as much expansion capability. The BBB<a id="id3" class="calibre1"/> supports many more <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Input/Output</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">IO</strong></span>) options, including <a id="id4" class="calibre1"/>three I2C buses, multiple serial ports, 65 <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">General Purpose IO</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">GPIO</strong></span>), multiple <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Pulse Width Modulators</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">PWM</strong></span>), and seven analog<a id="id5" class="calibre1"/> inputs with built-in <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Analog-to-Digital Converters</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">ADCs</strong></span>).

This is a complete manual that covers connecting the BBB, power options, and boot sequences. Many of the questions asked on the BeagleBoard mailing list and IRC channel can be quickly answered in this manual. The author of this book assumes that you've at least skimmed sections 3, 4, and 5 of the SRM, which means you are aware of the basic capabilities of BBB and are familiar with the physical connectors. There is simply no better reference for the BBB than this document.</p></div></div>

OSHW is a relatively new concept, the exact definition<a id="id8" class="calibre1"/> of which may confuse people. However, there is a group, the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">OSHW Association</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">OSHWA</strong></span>), whose mission is to <a id="id9" class="calibre1"/> educate and promote OSHW. Their <a id="id10" class="calibre1"/>definition is maintained on their website: <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.oshwa.org/definition/">http://www.oshwa.org/definition/</a>. As with most organizations, a consensus for a definition <a id="id11" class="calibre1"/>can be difficult to obtain. The definition of OSHW is well over a page. The complication with defining OSHW from open source software is that hardware is a <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">physical thing</em></span>. There are design files to manufacture hardware, but there are physical components also. To make a software analogy, the compiler for the hardware is the manufacturer. Therefore, the definition of OSHW is carefully constructed and it generally applies to the design files of the hardware.</p><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note02" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">Alicia Gibb, the Executive Director of OSHWA, gave a TEDx talk called <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">The Death of Patents and What Comes After</em></span> (<a class="calibre1" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z__Sbw1Ax4o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z__Sbw1Ax4o</a>).

A recent BBB<a id="id17" class="calibre1"/> will come with the Debian distribution of GNU/Linux, henceforth referred to as Debian, installed on the eMMC. eMMC is the on-board flash memory for the BBB. As soon as power is applied to the board, BBB will start to boot from the eMMC. As shown in section three of the SRM, you can connect the BBB directly to your PC with the supplied USB cable. The BBB can also be powered from a 5V barrel jack, where you'll want a wall adapter that can supply up to 1A.

As an editor, Emacs is often overlooked because of its reputation of being outdated and difficult to learn. Emacs can be overwhelming since the interface is different from most modern interfaces. Also, the keybindings were created prior to the invention of modern <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Graphical User Interfaces</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">GUIs</strong></span>), so <a id="id24" class="calibre1"/>the keybindings don't correspond to the shortcuts that you are typically accustomed to. However, there is active development on various Emacs <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">starter packs</em></span>, which provide a smoother Emacs experience. If you keep in mind that Emacs predates your operating system, you may find it easier to accept the Emacs way.</p><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="note05" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">Many early notable programmers have worked on Emacs, including Guy Steele, Richard Stallman, James Gosling, and Jamie Zawinski. The design of Emacs was presented by Richard Stallman in 1981 to the ACM Conference on Text Processing; the full text is available at <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html</a>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">Embedded development is slightly more complicated than web or desktop development because there are typically two machines involved: the host (your main computer) and the target (your embedded platform). Embedded systems range in capabilities and some run without an operating system, which certainly can't support running a compiler. In this case, the user cross-compiles the code on the host for the target. This can be performed for the BBB, but compiling small programs natively on the BBB does not take too long.</p><p class="calibre7">A <a id="id25" class="calibre1"/>common recommendation for development on the BBB is to connect to the device over <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Secure Shell</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">SSH</strong></span>) and to use<a id="id26" class="calibre1"/> command-line tools. This can be an effective technique, but this limits you to the command line and your terminal emulator. These tools are very powerful and in this context, limited does not mean limited in functionality but limited in the interface.</p><p class="calibre7">The one helpful feature of Emacs for embedded development is <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Transparent Remote Access Multiple Protocol</strong></span> or the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">TRAMP</strong></span> mode. In short, the TRAMP mode lets you run Emacs on your host machine, which is most likely more powerful than the BBB, but access files and run commands on the BBB as if they were local. This is transparent in TRAMP; working in this environment feels like you are working on a host, not on an embedded platform. The following screenshot shows the TRAMP feature of Emacs:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00002.jpeg" alt="Understanding the complications of embedded development" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">This screenshot was captured with Emacs running on Mac OS X, but connected to a BBB with the hostname <code class="email">slartibartfast</code>.

This <a id="id39" class="calibre1"/>section will illustrate the basic skills that one needs to use Emacs and more importantly, to learn how to use Emacs. One of the best features of Emacs is the immense built-in help. If you have never run Emacs before, press <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Ctrl-h t</em></span>, abbreviated <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">C-h t</em></span>. This means that while holding the <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em></span> key, press <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">h</em></span>, then release it, and then press <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">t</em></span>. Also, note that the Emacs commands are case sensitive. <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">C-H T </em></span>means to press <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Ctrl + Shift + H</em></span>, then hit <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Shift + T</em></span>, whereas <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">C-h t</em></span> is performed without the shift modifier. You'll be presented with the interactive Emacs tutorial. This tutorial will teach you the fundamentals of Emacs. In the tutorial, you'll see references to a meta key, which you will be hard pressed to find on your keyboard. Command sequences, such as <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">M-x</em></span>, mean to hold down the meta key while pressing <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">x</em></span>. Depending on your system, the meta key may be <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Alt</em></span> or <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Option</em></span>.

If you run the BBB from the USB cable attached to your PC, then the default Internet Protocol (IP) address of the BBB will be <code class="email">192.168.7.2</code>. However, if you want to download software directly to the BBB, as you will need to do in order to complete these projects, you'll have to forward your Internet connection from the PC to the BBB. Also, when powered from the USB directly, there is typically a 500mA current limit. When the BBB is powering expansion boards or other peripherals, it'll need to be powered from a 5V DC plug that can supply up to 1A. As a result of these two issues, you may find it much more convenient to run the BBB from a 5V power supply and connect the Ethernet cable into your home network directly.</p><p class="calibre7">When you do this, the IP address will most likely be assigned by your router and will only be known to your router. This will leaving you staring at the BBB pontificating over its IP address.</p><div class="book" title="Discovering the IP address of your networked BBB"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01" class="calibre1"/>Discovering the IP address of your networked BBB</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">There <a id="id44" class="calibre1"/>are a few ways to <a id="id45" class="calibre1"/>discover the IP address of your<a id="id46" class="calibre1"/> device. The first way is to log in to your router and look up the IP address. This is a quick method but as there are numerous routers, you'll have to consult your router's documentation on how to accomplish this.</p><p class="calibre7">You can also use the <code class="email">nmap</code> utility to conduct a quick <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">ping scan</strong></span> on your network. Assuming<a id="id47" class="calibre1"/> that you are familiar with the IP address of your own network, you should be able to see a new device. If you are running an apt-based distribution, you can install <code class="email">nmap</code> with <code class="email">sudo apt-get install nmap</code>. If you<a id="id48" class="calibre1"/> are on a Mac, you can use the homebrew package manager (<a class="calibre1" href="http://brew.sh/">http://brew.sh/</a>) and install it with <code class="email">brew install nmap</code>. Windows<a id="id49" class="calibre1"/> users should download the binary<a id="id50" class="calibre1"/> from <a class="calibre1" href="http://nmap.org/download.html#windows">http://nmap.org/download.html#windows</a>. Once it is installed, you'll want to run a command similar to the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24</strong></span>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Replace <code class="email">192.168.1.0</code> with the appropriate address for your network. <code class="email">/24</code> is the <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Classless Inter-Domain Routing</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">CIDR</strong></span>) notation for the subnet mask. In this case, <code class="email">/24</code> means use a subnet mask of 24 bits of 1's, or <code class="email">255.255.255.0</code>. The <code class="email">-sn</code> option directs <code class="email">nmap</code> to conduct a ping scan.</p><p class="calibre7">If you are still unable to determine the IP address, you can buy a USB-to-serial adapter cable. BBB has a serial debug header located inboard of the P9 header. You can attach the USB-to-serial adapter to BBB's serial debug header, as shown in the following image:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00004.jpeg" alt="Discovering the IP address of your networked BBB" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">In this figure, pin 1 (which is the black wire) is the ground, pin 4 is receive, and pin 5 is transmit. Once <a id="id51" class="calibre1"/>physically attached, you'll need a terminal emulator to connect over the serial connection. GNU Screen is a widely available, free, and robust software that will connect with the following command; just replace <code class="email">/dev/tty.XXXX</code> with the file of your connection:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">screen /dev/tty.PL2303-004014FA 115200</strong></span>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Lastly, you <a id="id52" class="calibre1"/>can set a static<a id="id53" class="calibre1"/> IP for your BBB. Your router may <a id="id54" class="calibre1"/>support a static lease feature, which will assign the IP of your choosing to the device when it performs a <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">DHCP</strong></span>) request. The lease on this request can be indefinite <a id="id55" class="calibre1"/>and, therefore, effectively provides a <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">static</em></span> IP. You can also set the IP statically on your device, but then you will have to manage conflicts manually. Therefore, the preferred method is to let the router handle this situation.</p><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip06" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">To find <a id="id56" class="calibre1"/>a serial debugging cable, see the eLinux page at <a class="calibre1" href="http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBone_Black_Serial">http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBone_Black_Serial</a>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">To take full advantage of the SSH configuration options in the following section, you'll want to have a static IP set. Otherwise, you will have to repeat the previous steps to determine the IP address of the device when your router power cycles or if the BBB is disconnected for a few days.</p><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip07" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">If you prefer to use a WiFi connection instead of Ethernet, be aware that there are issues with some dongles.

<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">ssh debian@192.168.1.10</strong></span>
</pre></div><div class="informalexample" title="Note"><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip08" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">If you are a Windows user, you should consider using more Unixy tools on your host since the<a id="id59" class="calibre1"/> BBB is running Debian anyway. You can install Cygwin (<a class="calibre1" href="https://www.cygwin.com/">https://www.cygwin.com/</a>), which will give you a nice shell with<a id="id60" class="calibre1"/> the associated command-line tools. Or, consider downloading VirtualBox (<a class="calibre1" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a>) and installing a GNU/Linux distribution in a virtual machine.</p></div><p class="calibre7">The default username is <code class="email">debian</code> and the default password is <code class="email">temppwd</code>. If you only have one device, typing this command may be manageable. Once you start collecting BBBs, Raspberry Pis, pcDuinos, Cubieboards, Arduinos with a WiFly Shield, and so on, you will have to remember each IP, username, and password. This can become annoying. Fortunately, there are a few tricks that you can use to improve this situation.</p><p class="calibre7">First, you'll need a SSH private key. If you don't already have a key, you can generate one on your host with the following command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096</strong></span>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Now edit the <code class="email">~/.ssh/config</code> file. If you are doing this in Emacs, you can press <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">C-x C-f</em></span> and then type <code class="email">~/.ssh/config</code>. Emacs keybindings are all bound to Emacs Lisp commands (technically, there are a few basic commands implemented in C). The keybinding <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">C-x C-f</em></span> is bound to the <code class="email">find-file</code> function. An alternate, albeit longer, way to open a file is to press <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">M-x</em></span>, type <code class="email">find-file</code>, then open the file of your choice.</p><p class="calibre7">Add the following section to your <code class="email">~/.ssh/config</code> file, replacing HostName with the IP address of your BBB:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">Host bbb</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">     HostName 192.168.1.10</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">     User debian</strong></span>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Now, you can SSH into the BBB just by typing <code class="email">ssh bbb</code>. Add as many servers as you want <a id="id61" class="calibre1"/>here and give them descriptive <a id="id62" class="calibre1"/>names, and this will you manage your connections.</p></div><div class="book" title="Configuring password-less login"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch01lvl3sec03" class="calibre1"/>Configuring password-less login</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">If you've<a id="id63" class="calibre1"/> followed the above step, then<a id="id64" class="calibre1"/> connecting to your BBB is now simplified with the exception of entering the password. Connect to your BBB and run the <code class="email">ssh-keygen</code> command on BBB. This will create the <code class="email">.ssh</code> directory for you. You don't have to generate an SSH key; you could just create the <code class="email">.ssh</code> directory, but chances are that you may need an SSH key anyway and this will accomplish both tasks.</p><p class="calibre7">Before you log out, we need to perform one bit of maintenance. We need to regenerate the SSH host key, the key on the BBB, since the key on your device was cloned from an image. The process involves just a few commands but requires running them as root. You can either type <code class="email">sudo su</code> and become root and run the commands, or append <code class="email">sudo</code> in front of each <a id="id65" class="calibre1"/>command in the following code snippet, based off the Nix Craft article at <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-regenerate-openssh-host-keys/">http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-regenerate-openssh-host-keys/</a>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server</strong></span>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">This will delete your existing SSH host key and regenerate it from scratch. Since the host key has changed, we need to update your SSH client on you main computer. If you log in to the BBB again, you will probably receive a warning that the fingerprint doesn't match because you changed it. You can remove the old entry from your client by typing the following (you may have to use the IP address instead of <code class="email">bbb</code>):</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">ssh-keygen -R bbb</strong></span>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Alternatively, you can edit <code class="email">~/.ssh/known_hosts</code> directly and remove the entry.</p><p class="calibre7">With the new SSH key on the BBB and the old entry in <code class="email">known_hosts</code> removed, log back in to the BBB just to make sure everything is working. Log back out and return to the terminal on your host. After executing the following command, you will no longer be prompted for a password:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh bbb 'cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys'</strong></span>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">This will copy your public SSH key to the BBB, which will be recognized in the SSH handshake as an authorized key, and therefore, it will not require you to enter the <code class="email">debian</code> user's password.</p><p class="calibre7">Most likely, you will need to perform this operation again and you may not want to refer to this book to find this command. You can add this function to your <code class="email">.bashrc</code> file or an equivalent for further ease of use:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">ssh_upload(){
  if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then
    echo "usage: host\nNOTE: host should be set in ~/.ssh/config"
    else
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh $1 'cat &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
    fi
}</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Then, you<a id="id66" class="calibre1"/> can add your key to servers<a id="id67" class="calibre1"/> with:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre8">ssh_upload bbb</strong></span>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Don't forget to reload your <code class="email">.bashrc</code> file to gain this function with:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">source ~/.bashrc</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Logging out and in again will also work.</p></div><div class="book" title="Running an SSH agent to control access to your SSH keys"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch01lvl3sec04" class="calibre1"/>Running an SSH agent to control access to your SSH keys</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Now <a id="id68" class="calibre1"/>you don't have to enter the <code class="email">debian</code> account password each time you log in to the BBB, but now<a id="id69" class="calibre1"/> you do have to enter the password for your SSH private key. This is equally annoying. However, we can fix this by running <code class="email">ssh-agent</code>. Installing and configuring <code class="email">ssh-agent</code> is OS-dependent, and instructions are easy to find online. Once <code class="email">ssh-agent</code> is running, you'll typically have to enter <a id="id70" class="calibre1"/>your SSH<a id="id71" class="calibre1"/> private key password when you log in and if you make an SSH connection within a certain time period, you'll instantly connect to the remote server without any additional password entry.</p></div></div></div>

Certain commands are TRAMP-aware and will execute remotely. For example, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">M-!</em></span> will execute a shell command. When used over TRAMP, it will execute the shell command remotely. Try using <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">M-!</em></span> with <code class="email">touch</code> <code class="email">test.txt</code>. Now press <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">g</em></span> to refresh <code class="email">dired</code>. You should now see <code class="email">test.txt</code>.

Technically, you are editing a local copy of this buffer but when you save it with <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">C-x C-s</em></span>, it will send the changes over to the BBB.</p><p class="calibre7">There is a benefit to this system. If the SSH connection drops, for whatever reason, the buffer is still in RAM on your local machine. Once the connection is restored, Emacs will save the buffer. Emacs acts as a session manager for your remote connections and will transparently reconnect when needed.</p><p class="calibre7">If you open a C file in Emacs, Emacs will apply C-aware syntax highlighting, but it can also compile and debug over TRAMP. To compile, invoke <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">M-x</em></span>, type <code class="email">compile</code>, and supply the compile command. If there is a makefile, then <code class="email">make</code> should suffice; otherwise, provide the full <code class="email">gcc</code> compilation string. The benefit of using the compile function is that Emacs will be aware of compilation errors and you can jump to each one with <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">C-x</em></span>`. Lastly, if you install <code class="email">gdb</code> on BBB, you debug with <code class="email">gdb</code> from your host computer. Assuming that you compiled your program with debug symbols, if you are looking at the source file in the current buffer, you can press <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">M-x</em></span>, and then type <code class="email">gdb</code>.</p><p class="calibre7">You'll have to provide the <code class="email">gdb</code> command, which is something such as <code class="email">gdb nameofexec -i=mi</code>. Emacs will remotely launch <code class="email">gdb</code> and open an interactive session. If you set breakpoints, Emacs will switch over to the code buffer and show you where the instruction pointer has stopped in the code.</p><p class="calibre7">Lastly, you can run a shell inside Emacs on the remote system as well. If you are in a TRAMP-aware buffer, pressing <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">M-x</em></span> and then typing <code class="email">shell</code> will open a remote shell. You can perform all your development actions while never leaving Emacs. Emacs can also act as your mail reader, calculator, IRC client, and even play Tetris (by pressing <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">M-x</em></span>, and then typing <code class="email">Tetris</code>).

If not, you will still be able to complete the projects but you may not appreciate the theory behind them.</p><p class="calibre7">As this is not a book on cryptography, a primer here will not provide enough detail for a beginner and will be woefully inadequate for someone familiar with the material. If cryptography is new to you, you can still proceed with the book. In the beginning of each chapter, there is some tailored background to explain the material, which should be enough for you to understand what the project is trying to accomplish. Once complete, hopefully, you'll be interested in cryptography and you can get more information from the following resources.</p><p class="calibre7">For a gentle introduction to the topic, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Cryptography: A Very Short Introduction</em></span> by <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Fred Piper and Sean Murphy</em></span>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Oxford University Press</em></span>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">2002</em></span>, is good starting point. However, as the title suggests, it lacks technical depth. <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Understanding Cryptography: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners</em></span> by <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Christof Paar et. al.</em></span>,<span class="strong"><em class="calibre9"> Springer, 2010</em></span>, is a more detailed introduction. For the more inquisitive readers, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Introduction to Modern Cryptography</em></span> by <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell</em></span>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Chapman and Hall/CRC</em></span>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">2007</em></span>, is a good up-to-date reference.</p><p class="calibre7">If lectures better suit you, you are in luck. Khan Academy has some interesting and free mini-lectures <a id="id86" class="calibre1"/>covering ancient cryptography up to RSA (<a class="calibre1" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography">https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography</a>). Another free resource is Coursera, which has three cryptography classes, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Cryptography I and II</em></span> taught by Standford Professor Dan Boneh, and a Cryptography class on modern cryptography taught by Jonathan Katz. The links for these classes are <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto">https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto</a>, <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto2">https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto2</a>, and <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/cryptography">https://www.coursera.org/course/cryptography</a>, respectively.</p></div></div>

At a minimum, you should read <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Chapter 6, Maintenance and Updates: The APT Tools</em></span>, of this book, which details how to<a id="id91" class="calibre1"/> use the apt set of tools for package management. There is also a free class offered by the Linux Foundation and edX called <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Introduction to Linux</em></span> (<a class="calibre1" href="https://www.edx.org/course/linuxfoundationx/linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-introduction-1621">https://www.edx.org/course/linuxfoundationx/linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-introduction-1621</a>). The class is fairly recent and it does not appear to use the Debian distribution, but it does seem like a representative course on generic Linux information. Lastly, there are several Debian IRC channels on the OFTC IRC network. Most of the channels start with <code class="email">#debian</code> and you should be <a id="id92" class="calibre1"/>able <a id="id93" class="calibre1"/>to ask specific questions there. The BeagleBoard channel is <code class="email">#beagle</code> on <code class="email">Freenode</code>, and there will be people there who can help answer your questions as well.</p></div></div>

You learned that the definitive reference manual for the BBB is the <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">System Reference Manual</em></span>, which should be your first stop for hardware-related questions about BBB. You learned about Emacs and how to create an embedded development environment with Emacs. Lastly, we identified several resources to find additional information on cryptography, electronics, and Linux.</p><p class="calibre7">In the rest of this book, you will build projects around the most popular and trusted software security packages: Tor, GNU Privacy Guide, and Off-the-Record messaging, all of which are actively used and maintained. In the next chapter, we'll use Tor and the BBB to help strengthen a censorship-resistant network.</p></div></body></html>
