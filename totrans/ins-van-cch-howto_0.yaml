    and your application servers, acting as a front-end caching solution to your website.
    Varnish Cache is not a complete solution and will not serve your application content
    on its own; instead, it will proxy customers'' requests to your web server and
    store their responses for later usage, avoiding an unnecessary (duplicated) workload.'
