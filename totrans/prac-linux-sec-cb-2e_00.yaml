    of all stages. A good knowledge of the fundamentals of Linux is essential to implementing
    a good security policy on the machine.

    the administrator to configure the machine in a way such that it becomes more
    secure. *Practical Linux Security Cookbook* will work as a practical guide for
    administrators and help them configure a more secure machine.
