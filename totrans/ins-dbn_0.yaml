- en: APT, one of the technologies that made Debian (and its derivatives, such as
    Ubuntu) highly popular, became mainstream for production deployments during the
    same time span that web applications broke through the barriers of enterprise
    fitness, reliability, and scalability.

- en: The flexibility of Debian systems makes it very appealing for web DevOps and
    modern web apps. This book tries to simplify deployment and reduce time-to-market,
    while providing a solid foundation for you to grow your Debian sysadmin practices.

- en: In the first part of the book we’ll help you choose the right flavor of Debian,
    install it, and prepare for multiple and massive installations, should you need
    it. We will also guide you through the initial APT setup, installing the stack,
    and configuring storage and frameworks.

- en: In the second part of the book, we harden the installation, analyze scalability
    paths, and learn how to effectively maintain your system, including backup/restore
    and performance. We also provide a future look at cloud and incident response,
    which will help you get the most out of your installation in the long run.

    administration, such as how to work with files and permissions, command line instructions,
    and how service and processes work in Linux, although the chapters are not technically
    demanding. While the book does not require previous knowledge on the APT system,
    it does expect readers to understand how the particular configuration files for
    the services Apache, Nginx, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and so on, work.
