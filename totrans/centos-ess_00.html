It has a fully automated update system, no package manager, and a fully clustered architecture.</p><p>Whether you are a Linux expert or just a beginner with some knowledge of Linux, this book will provide you with step-by-step instructions on installing and configuring CoreOS servers as well as building development and production environments. You will be introduced to the new CoreOS rkt Application Containers runtime engine and Google's Kubernetes system, which allows you to manage a cluster of Linux containers as a single system.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
