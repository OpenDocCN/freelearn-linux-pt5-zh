    enough if we have a few attributes to add, it may become painful as the number
    of attributes grows, either upon adding or removing them. The driver will have
    to loop over the attributes to create each of them or invoke `sysfs_create_file()`
    as many times as there are attributes. Here is where the attribute group comes

    in the kobject's directory when defining a group of attributes. If, however, a
    `name` is supplied, a subdirectory will be created for the attributes, with the
    directory's name being the name of the attribute group. `is_visible()` is an optional
    callback that intends to return the permissions associated with a specific attribute
    in the group. It will be called repeatedly for each (non-binary) attribute in
    the group. This callback must then return the read/write permission of the attribute,
    or `0` if the attribute is not supposed to be accessed at all. `is_bin_visible()`
    is the counterpart of `is_visible()` for binary attributes. The returned value/permission
    will replace the static permissions that have been defined in `struct attribute`.
    The `attrs` element is a pointer to a `NULL` terminated list of attributes, while
    `bin_attrs` is its counterpart for binary attributes.

    kobject directory. A well-known example is devices appearing in both `/sys/bus`
    and `/sys/devices` since a bus controller is first a device on its own before
    exposing a bus. However, note that any symbolic links that are created will be
