    can connect to it and use its services. In this chapter, we shall look at the
    different services and protocols supported by FreeNAS, and see examples of how
    various platforms like Windows, OS X, and Linux can use the FreeNAS server for
    file sharing, backup, and streaming multimedia.

    types of computers system using a variety of protocols. Before looking at each
    of these protocols individually, it is worth looking at them as a whole and seeing
    why each protocol exists and for which job is it best suited.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The table below lists each protocol along with which type of computer (Windows,
    Apple Mac etc) can connect to the FreeNAS server using that protocol. Some protocols
    are native to a particular platform, for examples CIFS is native protocol for
    Windows machines, but other operating systems like OS X can "talk" CIFS as well.
    Also listed, is the main use of that protocol.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Common Internet File System (CIFS) is the standard way in which files are
    accessed on a remote Windows computer. Developed and maintained by Microsoft for
    use on their Windows platform, it has also been implemented on most major operating
    systems including OS X and Linux using 3rd party software, the most popular of
    which is called Samba. Samba is open source software that provides remote file
    access services to CIFS clients on a variety of platforms (including to Windows
    clients). Samba is included in the FreeNAS server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The abilities of CIFS are actually larger than just accessing files. With it,
    other resources like printers can also be shared on the network, but for FreeNAS,
    CIFS is used to share disks on the server and make them available to other computers
    that understand the CIFS protocol. This means that Windows, Linux, and OS X machines
    are all capable of accessing files on the FreeNAS server via the CIFS protocol.

    and user management in FreeNAS in the next chapter. The NetBios Name is the name
    that the FreeNAS server will have on the Windows network. When you want to access
    the server, Windows lets you use a friendly name rather than the IP. For this
    example, we will use the name FreeNAS. Finally, you need to enter the workgroup.

    of computers that share a similar tag or designation. On a home network, there
    is normally only 1 workgroup called "WORKGROUP" (or MSHOME if you mainly have
    Windows XP machines. For the small office environment, there might be 2 or 3 workgroups,
    maybe "SALES", "ENGINEERING", and "ACCOUNTS". The workgroup links the machines
    together so that when the network is viewed, these machines will be grouped together.
    There are typically no more than ten to twenty computers in a workgroup and all
    the computers must be on the same local network.

    GeeXboX is a free Linux distribution that turns a computer into a Home Theater
    PC or Media Center. It is a standalone LiveCD-based distribution, meaning it boots
    from the CD and runs out of the box on any modern PC. It can even be used on a
    diskless computer, as the whole system is loaded in RAM. Much like FreeNAS, you
    need to download the `.ISO` image file and burn it onto a CD and then boot the
    PC from the CD.

- en: iSCSI is an evolution of the SCSI protocol, which allows SCSI commands to be
    sent over a network. It allows two hosts to negotiate and then exchange SCSI commands
    using IP networks. The result is that a remote device with iSCSI capabilities
    can be seen to be a local disk drive but the commands and data for that device
    are being sent over the network rather than down a cable in the machine.

    SCSI disk and it can receive SCSI commands and apply them to a local disk. Once
    configured, an iSCSI initiator can connect to the FreeNAS iSCSI target and use
    the designated disk as a local disk.

    and then the path to the extent. Here, you can choose a device like **/dev/ad0**
    or a file. For this example I will choose a file as this offers the greatest flexibility
    in that the same physical disk can be used to host several iSCSI targets (note
    however, that you get greater performance when using a whole device). The name
    for the file is in the format **/mnt/sharename/extentname** so in this example

    2048 for 2 gigabytes.'

- en: iSCSI disks behave in exactly the same way as local disks in that you can only
    have one computer controlling that disk. Therefore, it is important to ensure
    that only one iSCSI initiator uses any particular iSCSI target. If two (or more)
    iSCSI initiators use an iSCSI target, there will be data corruption.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One way to ensure that only one iSCSI initiator is using the iSCSI target is
    to limit the authorized network to just one IP address. If my iSCSI initiator
    has an IP address of 192.168.1.100, then entering that address along with 32 from
    the drop down box will limit iSCSI connections to just that IP address.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, if your iSCSI initiator doesn't have a fixed IP address (and is using
    DHCP), then you won't be able to permanently set the IP address. In this case,
    you can only limit the IP address to a range of addresses on your network. Assuming
    your FreeNAS server has a netmask of 255.255.255.0, enter the first 3 numbers
    of the IP address of the FreeNAS server (with . in between) and then finish it
    with dot zero (.0). For example, if the IP address of the FreeNAS server is 192.168.1.250,
    then you would enter 192.168.1.0 for the authorized network. Finally, select 24
    (in other words 255.255.255.0) in the drop down box.
