    and cloud administration technologies.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Technology evolves at an unprecedented speed, and Linux and related technologies
    are at the forefront of innovation. This makes it really hard to keep up and learn
    new things. Present Linux administrators need to know about more than just Linux,
    thus containerization and cloud technologies are essential for the future DevOps
    expert.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Linux is the operating system that powers almost everything, from IoT to personal
    computers to servers, and is the foundation for all cloud technologies. It enables
    you to master the cloud through the power of the command line.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will begin by learning about the command line, working with files, processes,
    users, packages, and filesystems, then you will begin administering network services
    and hardening security, and finally, you will learn about cloud computing, containers,
    and orchestration. You will learn how to work at the command line, learn about
    the most important Linux commands, and master users, processes, and services administration.
    You will also learn how to harden Linux security using iptables. At the end, you
    will work with containers, hypervisors, virtual machines, Ansible, and Kubernetes
    and learn how to deploy Linux on AWS and Azure. By the end of this book, you will
    have mastered Linux and you will be confident in working with Linux from bare
    metal to the cloud, in a pure DevOps fashion.
