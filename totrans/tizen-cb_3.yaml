    Although it must be clarified that on BlackBerry 10, the native applications are
    created with C++ and Qt/QML. Despite this, BlackBerry WebWorks also provides all

    Torvalds in 2005 as a tool for the development of the Linux kernel. It quickly

    images. A step-by-step tutorial as well as a lot of external links are provided.

    development of SoC. The company was established in 2007, and it became popular
    worldwide in 2010 with the launch of their SoC with Cortex-A8 processor, which
    is known as A10\. In 2013, Allwinner released A20, which features a dual core
    Cortex-A7 ARM processor.

    Android tablet AP shipment worldwide. A lot of popular single-board computers,
    such as OLinuXino, Cubieboard, and Banana Pi also use Allwinner processors with
    ARMv7 compatible architecture. All devices with Allwinner processors are also
    called Sunxi.

    on the market. They are important for the Tizen ecosystem as well, because they
    open the road to a lot of owners of Sunxi devices. Additionally, open source hardware
    devices with Allwinner processors, such as the boards from the OLinuXino series,
    provide excellent opportunities for innovation to start-up companies and enthusiasts
    with limited budgets.
