- en: Webmin is an open source, web-based system configuration tool written primarily
    in Perl. Thanks to its web nature, Webmin can be used to control your system remotely
    from any computer running a browser. It allows you to control numerous aspects
    of your system's configuration, such as managing users, installing additional
    software, configuring services, controlling access, and monitoring system activity.

- en: Installing Webmin on a Debian-based system, such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint, is
    easy because we can rely on the excellent package management system called **Advanced
    Packaging Tool** (**APT**). APT resolves and installs dependencies automatically
    and also ensures that Webmin will be updated automatically when you perform a
    system update.

- en: Webmin provides an online repository with DEB installation packages that are
    compatible with Debian-based systems. We need to give our system the address of
    this repository so that it can take advantage of it. The list of available repositories
    is kept in the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file as well as other `*.list` files stored
    in the `/etc/apt/source.list.d/` directory.

- en: Every package is cryptographically signed to ensure that even if someone breaks
    into the repository and uploads a package pretending to be Webmin, we don't install
    it by accident. We downloaded the public GPG key needed to verify this signature
    by using `wget` and added it to our list of trusted keys by using the `apt-key
    add` command.

- en: '**GNU Privacy Guard** (**GPG**) is an open source alternative to **Pretty Good
    Privacy** (**PGP**), a cryptographic software suite that provides encryption and
    authentication functions. Every Webmin package contains a GPG cryptographic signature,
    which could only be generated using a private key that is kept secret by Webmin''s
    author Jamie Cameron. A corresponding public key, which is made freely available,
    may be used to verify that the signature was generated using that private key.
    If even a single bit of the package code were modified after the package was signed,
    the signature would not match anymore. This ensures that nobody tampers with Webmin
    on its way between the author and your system. APT checks the signature automatically,
    we just need to provide it with Webmin''s public key.'
