- en: Before you can install the FreeNAS server, you will need to download the latest
    version from the FreeNAS website ([http://www.freenas.org](http://www.freenas.org)).
    Go to the download section and find the latest "LiveCD" version. The LiveCD version
    is what is known as an ISO image file and will have the `.iso` file extension.
    An ISO image is an exact copy of the structure and data for a CD or DVD disk.
    Using a CD burning program, you can create a FreeNAS bootable CD. We will look
    at this in more detail later on.

- en: In this chapter, we will start exploring FreeNAS, so you will need a machine
    on which to install the FreeNAS software. At this point in time, it doesn't have
    to be the final machine you are going to use as the FreeNAS server. You can use
    a "test" machine now and having learnt all about FreeNAS, you can build, install,
    and deploy a production machine (or machines) later.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, what we need now is a PC with at least 96Mb of RAM (but 128Mb or more is
    recommended), a bootable CD-ROM drive, a network card, one or more hard disks,
    and either a floppy disk drive (and a blank formatted disk) or a USB flash disk
    (MS-DOS formatted and empty).

    or USB flash disk will be for storing the configuration information.

    host machine during boot up. However, when you start to configure storage on the
    FreeNAS server (specifically, when you format drives) all the data on the disk
    will be LOST. Do NOT use a machine that contains important data or an operating
    system that you will need afterwards.

    you would run your applications like word processing and email. There is a technology
    (called virtualization), which allows PCs to run more than one operating system,
    or to be more precise, to allow a guest virtual PC to run inside your actual PC.
    This virtual PC is an independent software box that can run its own OS and applications
    as if it were a physical computer. A virtual PC behaves exactly like a physical
    PC and has its own virtual CPU, RAM, hard disk, and network interface card (NIC).

    between the virtual PC and any other physical machine, also, it appears on the

    environment for testing the FreeNAS server.

    to burn it to a CD. Having done that, put the CD into the PC as well as the flash
    disk and switch it on. Make sure that the BIOS is set to boot from CD. If it isn't,
    you need to enter into the BIOS and configure it to boot from CD. On many modern
    PCs, it is possible to select the boot device at start-up by pressing a special
    key (which is often either F8 or F12) to show a boot device menu. You can then

    network, then you can just leave it unchanged. However, if you need to change
    it then press 2 followed by *ENTER*. If you want the machine to get its address
    from DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), answer yes (y) to the IPv4 DHCP
    question, otherwise answer no (n). If you are not using DHCP, you can now enter
    the desired IP address. Next, you need to enter the subnet mask. For 255.255.255.0,
    enter 24, for 255.255.0.0 enter 16, and for 255.0.0.0, enter 8\. At this point,
    you can now skip the default gateway and DNS questions (by just pressing *ENTER*).
    If you do want to enter a default gateway and DNS server at this point, they will
    usually be the IP address of your Internet router. We won't be using IPv6 so the
    simplest thing to do now is just answer *yes* to the "Do you want to use AutoConfiguration
    for IPv6?" question. This will cause a small delay while FreeNAS tries (and probably
    fails) to get the IPv6 address but it is simpler than trying to enter the IPv6
    address manually!

    the hard drives, the CDROM, the floppy disk or even a USB flash disk. Which device
    the PC chooses first as its boot device can be changed by a built-in setup program.
    The setup program lets you modify basic system configuration settings. These settings

    the settings even when the power is switched off. During the POST sequence, there
    is normally a message telling you how to enter into the built-in setup program.

    (Power On Self Test) sequence. Here, the PC will check the amount of memory installed
    (which you can often see being counted on the screen) and which devices are connected
    (like hard drives and CDROMs). It should then start to boot from the CD. Here,
    FreeBSD (the underlying OS of FreeNAS) will start to boot, this is recognisable
    by the simple spinning wheel (made up of simple text characters like | - / and
    \ which are animated to give the appearance of spinning). The third step is the
    FreeNAS boot menu. This will appear for just five seconds and you should just
    let it boot normally which is the default. The final stage is when the FreeNAS
    logo appears and the system will boot as a FreeNAS server. You can tell when the
    system is fully loaded because the PC speaker will make some short but melodious
    beeps.

  prefs:

- en: IP stands for Internet Protocol and it is the basic low level language that
    computers use to talk to each other on the Internet. It is also used on private
    networks (in the office or at home) to connect different PCs and even printers
    to each other. An IPv4 address is made up of 4 sets of number (0 to 255) and is
    expressed in what is known as dot notation (meaning that each number has a dot
    between it). So 192.168.1.250 is an IP address, it also happens to be the default
    IP address for the FreeNAS server. Like email, the postal service and telephone,
    each destination (email account, mailbox or handset) needs a unique way of being
    identified. This is what IP addresses do; they allow each piece of equipment on
    the network to have a unique identifier so that messages can be addressed to the
    right place on the network.

- en: There are two ways in which you can obtain an IP address for the FreeNAS server.
    The first is to have the address assigned automatically via the DHCP service (Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol), and the second is to assign it manually.

- en: '**What is DHCP?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automates the assignment of IP
    addresses and other IP parameters (like subnet masks and default gateway). A computer
    that needs an IP address will send a request to the DHCP server and the server
    will reply with an IP address from a pool of addresses that have been set aside
    for this purpose. A DHCP server can be a PC or server (running Windows, OS X or
    Linux) as well as small devices like modern DSL modems and firewalls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advantage of the DHCP method is that the IP address assignment, all happens
    in the background and you don't need to worry about setting it yourself. The disadvantages
    are that first you need to have an already configured and running DHCP server
    on your network; and second, DHCP assigns addresses from a pool of available addresses.
    This means that every time the FreeNAS server boots, it is not guaranteed to have
    the same address as it had previously. This isn't a problem when using the CIFS
    protocol, however, for accessing the web interface or using protocols like FTP,
    it is desirable to have a stable IP address to refer to. However, for testing
    the FreeNAS server and learning about how it works using a DHCP assigned address
    could be acceptable for now.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So opting for the manual IP address, you now need to obtain two pieces of information.
    The first is the actual IP address for the FreeNAS and the second is what is known
    as the subnet mask. The subnet mask will also be expressed in the dot notation
    and is normally something like 255.255.255.0\. If you are in an office environment,
    you need to speak to the network administrator and he/she will be able to give
    you the information you need. If you are administering your own network, you need
    to choose an IP that isn't currently allocated to any other machine on your network
    (and also, isn't part of the address pool of any DHCP server on your network).

- en: The File Transfer Protocol is a fast and stable protocol for transferring files
    over a network. FTP is a client/server protocol and is most often used to transfer
    files from one machine to another in a "one off" sense. A connection is made,
    the files are transferred, and the connection is closed. This is a protocol that
    is often used to allow people to download files from the Internet. In the NAS
    context, it is very useful for offering a repository of software on your network
    (like software, company templates, and antivirus software updates).

    need to double click on *store* to enter into the *store* folder that represents
    the disk configured earlier. You can try dragging some files over from your Windows
    machines and see that they will be copied over to the FreeNAS server.

- en: Up until now, FreeNAS has been running from the "LiveCD", which means it boots
    from the CD and runs from memory without needing the operating system to be copied
    on to the hard drive. FreeNAS has an option to install itself on a hard drive
    or USB flash disk and will boot from there without needing the CD. For a hard
    drive install, the configuration data will be saved on the hard drive rather than
    on a USB flash disk or floppy disk.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The preferred way to install FreeNAS is onto a USB flash disk as this frees
    up an IDE or SCSI channel for extra storage. FreeNAS is optimized for use with
    flash disks. To save wearing out the flash disk, (with too many write operations)
    the embedded version of FreeNAS runs from memory once the initial boot has been
    made from the flash disk. To use the USB flash disk version, you need to have
    a BIOS that can boot from a USB flash disk.

- en: When you were in the installation submenu, you would have seen that there is
    also what is known as a "full" install of FreeNAS. This doesn't mean that it has
    any more features or is somehow more complete than the "embedded" version. But
    rather, it is a way to install FreeNAS like a traditional operating system. The
    files are installed on the hard disk and if they are edited or deleted they are
    done so permanently. The embedded version runs from RAM (and is initially loaded
    from the hard disk) and any changes made to the operating system files will only
    be temporary and when the system is rebooted, it will return to its original state.
    This means that the full version can be tweaked and changed which is good for
    those developing plugins for FreeNAS, but it also means that the system can be
    broken accidentally by those unfamiliar with FreeBSD. The embedded version, however,
    adds a level of protection and if anything goes wrong, a reboot will restore the
    system files to their installed state.
