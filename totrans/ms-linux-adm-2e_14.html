<p>No special technical requirements are needed as this chapter is a purely theoretical one. All you need is a desire to learn about cloud technologies.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-284"><a id="_idTextAnchor302"/>Introduction to cloud technologies</h1>
<p>The term “cloud computing,” or the simple alternative “cloud,” is not missing from any tech enthusiast’s or <strong class="bold">Information Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>) professional’s vocabulary these days. You don’t even have to be<a id="_idIndexMarker1979"/> involved in IT at all to hear (or even use) the term “cloud” relatively often. Today’s computing landscape is changing at a rapid pace, and the pinnacle of this change is the cloud and the technologies behind it. According to the literature, the term “cloud computing” was used for the first time in 1996, in a business plan from Compaq (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2011/10/31/257406/who-coined-cloud-computing/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2011/10/31/257406/who-coined-cloud-computing/</a>).</p>
<p>Cloud computing is a relatively old concept, even though it was not referred to using this term right from the beginning. It is a computing model that was used from the early days of computing. Back in the 1950s, for example, there were mainframe computers that were accessed from different terminals. This model is similar to modern cloud computing, where services are hosted and delivered over the internet to different terminals, from desktop computers to smartphones, tablets, or laptops. This model is based on technologies that are extremely complex and essential for anyone who wants to master them to know.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why we have an entire section dedicated to cloud computing and technologies inside a <em class="italic">Mastering Linux Administration</em> title. This is simply because Linux has taken over the cloud in the last decade, in the same way that Linux took over the internet and the high-performance computing landscape. According to the TOP500 association, the world’s top 500 supercomputers all run on Linux (<a href="https://top500.org/lists/top500/2020/11/">https://top500.org/lists/top500/2020/11/</a>). Clouds need to have an operating system to operate on, but it doesn’t have to be Linux. Nevertheless, Linux runs on almost 90% of public clouds (<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/state-of-linux-in-public-cloud-for-enterprises">https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/state-of-linux-in-public-cloud-for-enterprises</a>), mostly because its open source nature appeals to IT professionals inside the public and private sectors alike.</p>
<p>In the following section, we will tackle the subject of cloud standards and why it is good to know about them when planning to deploy or manage a cloud instance.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-285"><a id="_idTextAnchor303"/>Exploring the cloud computing standards</h2>
<p>Before going into more details <a id="_idIndexMarker1980"/>about cloud computing, let’s give you a short introduction to what cloud standards are and their importance in the overall contemporary cloud landscape. You may know that almost every activity in the wider <strong class="bold">Information and Communications Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">ICT</strong>) spectrum is governed<a id="_idIndexMarker1981"/> by some kind of standard or regulation.</p>
<p>Cloud computing is no wild land, and you will be surprised at how many associations, regulatory boards, and organizations are involved in developing standards and regulations for it. Covering all these institutions and standards is out of the scope of this book and chapter, but in the following sections, we will describe some of the most important and relevant ones (in our opinion) so that you can have an idea of their importance in keeping clouds together<a id="_idIndexMarker1982"/> and web applications running.</p>
<h3>International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission</h3>
<p>Two of the most widely known <a id="_idIndexMarker1983"/>standards entities are the <strong class="bold">International Organization for Standardization</strong> (<strong class="bold">ISO</strong>) and the <strong class="bold">International Electrotechnical Commission</strong> (<strong class="bold">IEC</strong>), and<a id="_idIndexMarker1984"/> they currently have 28<a id="_idIndexMarker1985"/> published and under-development standards on cloud computing and distributed platforms. They have a joint <a id="_idIndexMarker1986"/>task group to develop standards for specific cloud core infrastructure, consumer application platforms, and services. Those standards are found under the responsibility of the <strong class="bold">Joint Technical Committee 1</strong> (<strong class="bold">JTC 1</strong>) <strong class="bold">subcommittee 38</strong> (<strong class="bold">SC38</strong>), or <strong class="bold">ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 38</strong> for short.</p>
<p>Examples of standards from ISO/IEC include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker1987"/> computing <strong class="bold">service-level agreement</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLA</strong>) frameworks:<ul><li>ISO/IEC 19086-1:2016</li><li>ISO/IEC 19086-2:2018</li><li>ISO/IEC 19086-3:2017</li></ul></li>
<li>Cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker1988"/>computing <strong class="bold">service-oriented architecture</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOA</strong>) frameworks:<ul><li>ISO/IEC 18384-1:2016</li><li>ISO/IEC 18384-2:2016</li><li>ISO/IEC 18384-3:2016</li></ul></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Open Virtualization Format</strong> (<strong class="bold">OVF</strong>) specifications:<ul><li>ISO/IEC 17203:2017</li></ul></li>
<li>Cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker1989"/> computing <strong class="bold">data sharing agreement</strong> (<strong class="bold">DSA</strong>) frameworks:<ul><li>ISO/IEC CD 23751</li></ul></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Distributed application platforms and services</strong> (<strong class="bold">DAPS</strong>) technical principles:<ul><li>ISO/IEC TR 30102:2012</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>To take a closer look at those<a id="_idIndexMarker1990"/> standards, please go to <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/601355/x/catalogue/">https://www.iso.org/committee/601355/x/catalogue/</a>.</p>
<h3>The Cloud Standards Coordination initiative</h3>
<p>Next on our list of standards development<a id="_idIndexMarker1991"/> entities is an initiative called the <strong class="bold">Cloud Standards Coordination</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSC</strong>), created <a id="_idIndexMarker1992"/>by the <strong class="bold">European Commission</strong> (<strong class="bold">EC</strong>), together with<a id="_idIndexMarker1993"/> specialized bodies.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, the EC, together with the <strong class="bold">European Telecommunications Standards Institute</strong> (<strong class="bold">ETSI</strong>), launched the <a id="_idIndexMarker1994"/>CSC to develop standards and policies for cloud security, interoperability, and portability. The initiative had two phases, with Phase 1 starting in 2012 and Phase 2 starting in 2015. The final reports of Phase 2 (version 2.1.1), were made public, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud computing users’ needs (ETSI SR 003 381)</li>
<li>Standards and Open Source (ETSI SR 003 382)</li>
<li>Interoperability and Security (ETSI SR 003 391)</li>
<li>Standards Maturity Assessment (ETSI SR 003 392)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details on each of those standards, access the following link: <a href="http://csc.etsi.org/">http://csc.etsi.org/</a>.</p>
<h3>National Institute of Standards and Technology</h3>
<p>The list continues with one of the most widely known entities in standards development: the <strong class="bold">United States</strong> (<strong class="bold">US</strong>) <strong class="bold">National Institute of Standards and Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">NIST</strong>). This will not be the first time you will read about NIST in this book. It is the standards development body in the US Department of Commerce. The main objective of NIST is the standardization of security and interoperability inside US government agencies, so anyone interested in <a id="_idIndexMarker1995"/>developing for those entities should take a look at the NIST cloud documentation. The NIST document that standardizes cloud computing is called NIST SP 500-291r2 and can be found at <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf</a>.</p>
<h3>The International Telecommunication Union</h3>
<p>We will close our shortlisting with one of the oldest—if not the oldest—standards development bodies, part of the <strong class="bold">United Nations</strong> (<strong class="bold">UN</strong>) organization: the <strong class="bold">International Telecommunication Union</strong> (<strong class="bold">ITU</strong>). The ITU is a body inside the<a id="_idIndexMarker1996"/> UN, and its main focus is to develop standards for communications, networking, and development. This agency was founded in 1865 and, among<a id="_idIndexMarker1997"/> other things, it is responsible for global radio frequency spectrum and satellite orbit allocation. It is also responsible for the use of Morse code as a standard means of communication. When it comes to global information infrastructure, internet protocols, next-generation networks, <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>), and<a id="_idIndexMarker1998"/> smart cities, the ITU has a lot of standards and recommendations available. To check them all out, have a look at the following link: <a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Y/en">https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Y/en</a>. To narrow down the document list from the aforementioned link, some specific cloud computing documents can be found using document codes, from Y.3505 up to Y.3531. The cloud computing standards were developed by the <strong class="bold">Study Group 13</strong> (<strong class="bold">SG13</strong>) <strong class="bold">Joint Coordination Activity on Cloud Computing</strong> (<strong class="bold">JCA-Cloud</strong>) within the ITU.</p>
<p>Besides the entities described in this <a id="_idIndexMarker1999"/>section, there are many<a id="_idIndexMarker2000"/> others, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong class="bold">Cloud Standards Customer </strong><strong class="bold">Council</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSCC</strong>)</li>
<li>The <strong class="bold">Distributed Management Task </strong><strong class="bold">Force</strong> (<strong class="bold">DMTF</strong>)</li>
<li>The <strong class="bold">Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information </strong><strong class="bold">Standards</strong> (<strong class="bold">OASIS</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The main reason for adopting standards for <a id="_idIndexMarker2001"/>cloud computing is ease of use when it comes to either the <strong class="bold">Cloud Service Provider</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSP</strong>) or the client. Both categories need to have easy access to data, more<a id="_idIndexMarker2002"/> so for CSPs and application developers, as easy access to data is translated into agility and interoperability. However, standards, besides being technically correct, need to be consistent and persistent. According to the literature, there are two main <a id="_idIndexMarker2003"/>standards groups: ones that are established from practice, and ones that are being regulated. An important part of the cloud standards, from the second category, is the <strong class="bold">application programming interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">APIs</strong>). Standardization of <a id="_idIndexMarker2004"/>application frameworks, network protocols, and APIs guarantees success for everyone involved.</p>
<h3>Understanding the cloud through API standards</h3>
<p>APIs are sets of protocols, procedures, and functions: all the bricks needed to build a web-distributed application. Modern<a id="_idIndexMarker2005"/> APIs emerged at the beginning of the 21st century, firstly as a theory in Roy Fielding’s doctoral dissertation. Before<a id="_idIndexMarker2006"/> the modern APIs, there were SOA standards and the <strong class="bold">Simple Object Access Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOAP</strong>), based on <strong class="bold">Extensible Markup Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">XML</strong>). Modern<a id="_idIndexMarker2007"/> APIs are based on a new <a id="_idIndexMarker2008"/>application architectural style, called <strong class="bold">REpresentational State </strong><strong class="bold">Transfer</strong> (<strong class="bold">REST</strong>).</p>
<p>REST APIs are based on a series of architectural styles, elements, connectors, and views that are clearly described by Roy Fielding in his thesis. There are six guiding constraints for an API to be RESTful, and they are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uniform user interfaces</li>
<li>Client-server clear delineation</li>
<li>Stateless operations</li>
<li>Cacheable resources</li>
<li>Layered system of servers</li>
<li>Code on-demand execution</li>
</ul>
<p>Following these guiding<a id="_idIndexMarker2009"/> principles is far from following a standard, but REST provides them for developers as a high-level abstraction layer. Unless they are standardized, they will always remain great principles that generate confusion and frustration among developers.</p>
<p>The only organization that managed to standardize REST <a id="_idIndexMarker2010"/>APIs for the cloud is the DMTF, through the <strong class="bold">Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">CIMI</strong>) model and the RESTful <strong class="bold">HyperText Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">HTTP</strong>)-based protocol, in a document<a id="_idIndexMarker2011"/> coded DSP0263 version 2.0.0, which can be downloaded from the following link: <a href="https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cloud">https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cloud</a>.</p>
<p>There are other specifications that emerge as possible future standards for developers to use when designing REST APIs. Among those, there is the <strong class="bold">OpenAPI Specification</strong> (<strong class="bold">OAS</strong>), an industry standard that <a id="_idIndexMarker2012"/>provides a language-agnostic description for API development (document available at <a href="http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3">http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3</a>), and <strong class="bold">GraphQL</strong>, as a query<a id="_idIndexMarker2013"/> language and server-side runtime, with support for several programming languages <a id="_idIndexMarker2014"/>such as Python, JavaScript, Scala, Ruby, and <strong class="bold">PHP: Hypertext </strong><strong class="bold">Preprocessor</strong> (<strong class="bold">PHP</strong>).</p>
<p>REST managed to become the preferred API because it is easier to understand, more lightweight, and simple to write. It is more efficient, uses less bandwidth, supports many data formats, and uses <strong class="bold">JavaScript Object Notation</strong> (<strong class="bold">JSON</strong>) as the preferred data format. JSON is easy to read and write and <a id="_idIndexMarker2015"/>offers better interoperability between applications written in different languages, such as JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and Java. By using JSON as the default data format for the API, it makes it friendly, scalable, and platform-agnostic.</p>
<p>APIs are everywhere on<a id="_idIndexMarker2016"/> the web and in the cloud and are the base for SOA and microservices. For example, microservices use RESTful APIs to communicate between services by offering an optimized architecture for cloud-distributed resources.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to master cloud computing technologies, you should be open to embracing cloud standards. In the next section, we will discuss the cloud types and architecture.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-286"><a id="_idTextAnchor304"/>Understanding the architecture of the cloud</h2>
<p>The cloud’s architectural design is similar to a building’s architectural design. There is one design paradigm that governs the <a id="_idIndexMarker2017"/>cloud—the one in which the design starts from a blank, clean drawing board where the architects put together different standardized components in order to achieve an architectural design. The final result is based on a certain architectural style. The same happens when designing the cloud’s architecture.</p>
<p>The cloud is based on a client-server, layered, stateless, network-based architectural style. The REST APIs, SOA, microservices, and web technologies all are the base components that form the foundation of the cloud. The architecture of the cloud has been defined by NIST (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/nist-cloud-computing-reference-architecture">https://www.nist.gov/publications/nist-cloud-computing-reference-architecture</a>).</p>
<p>Some of the technologies behind the cloud have been discussed in <a href="B19682_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor231"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Virtual Machines</em>, and <a href="B19682_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor257"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Containers with Docker</em>. Indeed, both virtualization and containers are the foundation technologies of cloud computing.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine a situation where you <a id="_idIndexMarker2018"/>would like to have several Linux systems to deploy your apps. What you do first is go to a CSP and request the systems you need. The CSP will create the <strong class="bold">virtual machines</strong> (<strong class="bold">VMs</strong>) on its infrastructure, according to your needs, and<a id="_idIndexMarker2019"/> will put all of them in the same network and share the credentials to access them with you. This way, you will have access to the systems you wanted, in exchange for a subscription fee that is billed either on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis or based on a resource-consumption basis. Most of the time, those CSP requests are done through a specific web interface, developed by the provider to best suit the needs of their users.</p>
<p>Everything that the <a id="_idIndexMarker2020"/>cloud uses as technology is based on VMs and containers. Inside the cloud, everything is abstracted and automated. In the following section, we will provide you with information about the types of services that are available in the cloud.</p>
<h3>Describing the types of infrastructure and services</h3>
<p>No matter the type, each cloud has a specific architecture, just as we showed you in the previous section. It provides the <a id="_idIndexMarker2021"/>blueprints for the foundation of cloud computing. The cloud architecture is the base for the cloud infrastructure, and the infrastructure is the base for cloud services. See how everything is connected? Let’s now see what the infrastructure and services are with regard to the cloud.</p>
<p>There are four main <strong class="bold">cloud infrastructure types</strong>, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Public clouds</strong>: These run on infrastructure owned by the provider and are available mostly off-premises; the<a id="_idIndexMarker2022"/> largest public cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker2023"/>providers are AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Private clouds</strong>: These run specifically<a id="_idIndexMarker2024"/> for individuals<a id="_idIndexMarker2025"/> and groups with isolated access; they are available on both on-premises and off-premises hardware infrastructure. There are managed private clouds available, or dedicated private clouds.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Hybrid clouds</strong>: These are<a id="_idIndexMarker2026"/> both private and public clouds running<a id="_idIndexMarker2027"/> inside connected environments, with<a id="_idIndexMarker2028"/> resources available for potential on-demand scaling.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Multi-clouds</strong>: These are <a id="_idIndexMarker2029"/>more than one cloud running<a id="_idIndexMarker2030"/> from more than one provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the cloud infrastructure types, there are also four main <strong class="bold">cloud </strong><strong class="bold">service types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">IaaS</strong>: With an IaaS cloud service type, the cloud provider manages all hardware infrastructure such as servers and <a id="_idIndexMarker2031"/>networking, plus virtualization and <a id="_idIndexMarker2032"/>storage of data. The infrastructure is owned by the provider and rented by the user; in this case, the user needs to manage the operating system, the runtimes, automation, management solutions, and containers, together with the data and applications. IaaS is the backbone of every cloud computing service, as it provides all the resources.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">CaaS</strong>: This is considered to be a subset of IaaS; it has the same advantages as IaaS, only that the base consists<a id="_idIndexMarker2033"/> of containers, not VMs, and it is<a id="_idIndexMarker2034"/> better suited to deploying distributed systems and microservices architectures.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>: With a PaaS cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker2035"/> service type, the hardware infrastructure, networking, and <a id="_idIndexMarker2036"/>software platform are managed by the cloud provider; the user manages and owns the data and applications.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>: With a SaaS cloud service <a id="_idIndexMarker2037"/>type, the cloud provider manages and owns<a id="_idIndexMarker2038"/> the hardware, networking, software platform, management, and software applications. This type of service is also known for delivering web apps or mobile apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these types of services, there is another one<a id="_idIndexMarker2039"/> that we should bring into the discussion: <strong class="bold">serverless computing</strong> services. In contrast to what the name might suggest, serverless computing still implies the use of servers, but the infrastructure running them is not visible to users, who in most cases are developers. Serverless can also be referred to as <strong class="bold">Function as a Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">FaaS</strong>), and it provides an on-demand way to execute modular code, by letting developers update their code on the fly. Examples of this<a id="_idIndexMarker2040"/> kind of service would be AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions. It is similar to SaaS; actually, it would fit right between PaaS and SaaS. It has no infrastructure management, is scalable, offers a faster way to market for app developers, and is efficient when it comes to the use of resources.</p>
<p>Now that you know the types of cloud infrastructure and services, you might wonder why you, your business, or anyone you know should migrate to cloud services. First of all, cloud computing is <a id="_idIndexMarker2041"/>based on on-demand access to various resources that are hosted and managed by a CSP. This means that the infrastructure is owned or managed by the CSP and the user will be able to access the resources based on a subscription fee. Should you migrate to the cloud? We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of migrating to the cloud in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-287"><a id="_idTextAnchor305"/>Knowing the key features of cloud computing</h2>
<p>Before deciding whether migrating to the<a id="_idIndexMarker2042"/> cloud would be a good decision, you need to know the advantages and disadvantages of doing this. Cloud computing does provide some essential features, such as the following ones listed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Cost savings</strong>: There are reduced costs generated by the infrastructure setup, which is now managed by the CSP; this puts the user’s focus on application development and running the business.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Speed</strong>, <strong class="bold">agility</strong>, and <strong class="bold">resource access</strong>: All the resources are available from any place, just a few clicks away, at any time (dependent on internet connectivity and speed).</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Reliability</strong>: Resources are hosted in different locations, by providing good quality control, <strong class="bold">disaster recovery</strong> (<strong class="bold">DR</strong>) policies, and loss prevention; maintenance is done by the CSP, meaning that end users don’t need to waste time and money doing this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the advantages (key features) listed previously, there are possible disadvantages too, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Performance variations</strong>: Performance may vary depending on the CSP you choose, but none of the big names out<a id="_idIndexMarker2043"/> there (such as AWS, Azure, or GCP) have any significant performance issues. In these cases, performance is dictated by the local internet speed of the user, so it isn’t a CSP problem after all. This might not be the case for other CSPs though.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Downtime</strong>: Downtime could be an issue, but all major providers strive to offer 99.9% uptime. If disaster<a id="_idIndexMarker2044"/> strikes, issues are solved in a matter of minutes—or in worst-case scenarios, in a matter of hours.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Lack of predictability</strong>: There is a lack of predictability with regard to the CSP and its presence on the market, but rest assured that none of the big players will go away anytime soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, these are not game stoppers for anyone wanting to migrate to the cloud. In the next section, we will introduce you to some IaaS solutions.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-288"><a id="_idTextAnchor306"/>Introducing IaaS solutions</h1>
<p>IaaS is the backbone of cloud computing. It offers on-demand access to resources, such as compute, storage, network, and so on. The <a id="_idIndexMarker2045"/>CSP uses hypervisors to provide IaaS solutions. In this section, we provide you with information about some of the most widely used IaaS solutions<a id="_idIndexMarker2046"/> available. We will give you details about providers such as <strong class="bold">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> (<strong class="bold">Amazon EC2</strong>), and Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines as the big players, and <strong class="bold">DigitalOcean</strong> as a<a id="_idIndexMarker2047"/> viable solution. We will tackle <strong class="bold">OpenStack</strong> too, for those<a id="_idIndexMarker2048"/> interested in what it could offer.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-289"><a id="_idTextAnchor307"/>Amazon EC2</h2>
<p>The IaaS solution <a id="_idIndexMarker2049"/>provided by AWS is called Amazon EC2. It provides a good infrastructure solution for anyone, from low-cost compute<a id="_idIndexMarker2050"/> instances to a high-power <strong class="bold">graphics processing unit</strong> (<strong class="bold">GPU</strong>) for machine learning. AWS was the first <a id="_idIndexMarker2051"/>provider of IaaS solutions 12 years ago and it is doing better than ever, even after the COVID-19 pandemic (<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/">https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/</a>).</p>
<p>When starting with Amazon EC2, you have several steps to fulfill:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is the option to choose your <strong class="bold">Amazon Machine Image</strong> (<strong class="bold">AMI</strong>), which is basically a preconfigured <a id="_idIndexMarker2052"/>image of either Linux or Windows. When it comes to Linux, you can choose between the following:<ul><li>Amazon Linux 2 (based on <a id="_idIndexMarker2053"/>CentOS/<strong class="bold">Red Hat Enterprise </strong><strong class="bold">Linux</strong> (<strong class="bold">RHEL</strong>))</li><li>RHEL 8/9</li><li><strong class="bold">SUSE Linux Enterprise </strong><strong class="bold">Server</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLES</strong>)</li><li>Ubuntu<a id="_idIndexMarker2054"/> Server 20.04/22.04 <strong class="bold">Long-Term </strong><strong class="bold">Support</strong> (<strong class="bold">LTS</strong>)</li></ul></li>
<li>You will need to<a id="_idIndexMarker2055"/> choose your <strong class="bold">instance type</strong> from a really wide variety. To learn<a id="_idIndexMarker2056"/> more about EC2 instances, visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/</a> and find out details about each one. EC2, for example, is the <a id="_idIndexMarker2057"/>only provider that offers Mac instances, based on Mac mini. To use Linux, you can choose from low-end instances up to high-performance instances, depending on your needs.</li>
<li>Amazon provides an <strong class="bold">Elastic Block Store</strong> (<strong class="bold">EBS</strong>) option with <strong class="bold">solid-state drive</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSD</strong>) and magnetic <a id="_idIndexMarker2058"/>mediums available. You can select a custom value<a id="_idIndexMarker2059"/> depending on your needs. EC2 is a flexible solution compared to other options. It has an easy-to-use and straightforward interface, and you will only pay for the time and resources you use. An example of how to deploy on EC2 will be provided to you in <a href="B19682_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor326"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying to the Cloud with AWS </em><em class="italic">and Azure</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-290"><a id="_idTextAnchor308"/>Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>Microsoft is the second biggest player<a id="_idIndexMarker2060"/> in the cloud market, right after<a id="_idIndexMarker2061"/> Amazon. Azure is the name of their cloud computing offering. Even though it is provided by Microsoft, Linux is the most widely used operating system on Azure (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-developer-reveals-linux-is-now-more-used-on-azure-than-windows-server/">https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-developer-reveals-linux-is-now-more-used-on-azure-than-windows-server/</a>).</p>
<p>Azure’s IaaS offering is called <strong class="bold">Virtual Machines</strong> and is similar to Amazon’s offering; you can choose between many tiers. What is<a id="_idIndexMarker2062"/> different about Microsoft’s offering is the pricing model. They have a pay-as-you-go model, or a reservation-based instance, for one to three years. Microsoft’s interface is totally different from Amazon’s, and in our opinion might not be as straightforward as its competitor’s, but you will get used to it eventually.</p>
<p>Microsoft offers several types of VM instances, from economical burstable VMs to powerful memory-optimized instances. The pay-as-you-go model offers a per-hour cost, and this could add to the final<a id="_idIndexMarker2063"/> bill for those services, so choose with care based on your needs. When it comes to Linux distributions, you can choose from the following: CentOS, Debian, RHEL, SLES for SAP, openSUSE Leap, and Ubuntu <a id="_idIndexMarker2064"/>Server.</p>
<p>Azure has a very powerful SaaS offering too, and this will make it a good option if you use other Azure services. An example of how to deploy to Azure will be provided to you in <a href="B19682_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor326"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying to the Cloud with AWS </em><em class="italic">and Azure</em>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-291"><a id="_idTextAnchor309"/>Other strong IaaS offerings</h2>
<p>DigitalOcean is another important player in the cloud market and it offers a strong IaaS solution. It has a straightforward<a id="_idIndexMarker2065"/> interface and it helps you to create a cloud in <a id="_idIndexMarker2066"/>a very short time. They call their VMs <strong class="bold">droplets</strong> and you create one in a matter of seconds. All you have to do is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the image (Linux distribution)</li>
<li>Select the plan, based <a id="_idIndexMarker2067"/>on your <strong class="bold">virtual CPU</strong> (<strong class="bold">vCPU</strong>), memory, and disk space needs</li>
<li>Add storage blocks</li>
<li>Choose your data center region, authentication<a id="_idIndexMarker2068"/> method (password or <strong class="bold">Secure Shell</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSH</strong>) key), and hostname</li>
<li>You can also assign droplets to certain projects you manage</li>
</ul>
<p>DigitalOcean’s interface is better looking and much more user friendly than its competitors. Following the example of<a id="_idIndexMarker2069"/> DigitalOcean, other IaaS providers—such as <strong class="bold">Linode</strong> and <strong class="bold">Hetzner</strong>—provide a <a id="_idIndexMarker2070"/>slim and friendly interface for creating virtual servers.</p>
<p>Linode is another strong competitor in the cloud market, offering powerful solutions. Their VMs are called Linodes. The<a id="_idIndexMarker2071"/> interface is somewhere between DigitalOcean and Azure, with regard to their ease of use and appearance.</p>
<p>Another strong player, at least in the European market, is Hetzner, a Germany-based cloud provider. They offer a great balance between resources and cost, and similar solutions to the others mentioned in this section. They provide an interface similar to DigitalOcean that is really easy to explore, and the cloud instance will be deployed in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>Similar to the offerings of DigitalOcean, Linode, and Hetzner, there is a relatively new offering from <a id="_idIndexMarker2072"/>Amazon (starting in 2017), called <strong class="bold">Lightsail</strong>. This service was introduced in order to offer clients an<a id="_idIndexMarker2073"/> easy way to deploy <strong class="bold">virtual private servers</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPSs</strong>) or VMs in the cloud. The interface is similar to that seen from the competition, but it comes with the full Amazon infrastructure reliability on top. Lightsail provides several distributions, together with application <a id="_idIndexMarker2074"/>bundles. Deploying on AWS, using Lightsail, becomes more straightforward. It is a useful tool to lure in new users wanting a quick and secure solution for delivering their web apps.</p>
<p>There are other solutions available, such as Google’s <a id="_idIndexMarker2075"/>solution, called GCE, which is the IaaS solution from <strong class="bold">Google Cloud Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">GCP</strong>). The GCP interface is very similar to the one on the Azure platform.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
<p class="callout">One interesting aspect of using GCP is that when you want to delete a project, the operation is not immediate, and the deletion is scheduled in one month’s time. This could be seen as a safety net if the deletion was not intentional, and you need to roll back the project.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will detail some of the PaaS solutions.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-292"><a id="_idTextAnchor310"/>Introducing PaaS solutions</h1>
<p>PaaS is another form of cloud computing. Compared to IaaS, PaaS provides the hardware layer together with an <a id="_idIndexMarker2076"/>application layer. The hardware and software are hosted by the CSP, with no need to manage them from the client side. Clients of PaaS solutions are, in the majority of cases, application developers. The CSPs that offer PaaS solutions are mostly the same as those that offer IaaS solutions. We have Amazon, Microsoft, and Google as the major PaaS providers. In the following subsections, we will discuss some PaaS solutions.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-293"><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/>Amazon Elastic Beanstalk</h2>
<p>Amazon offers the <strong class="bold">Elastic Beanstalk</strong> service, whose interface is straightforward. You can create a sample application or upload your own, and Beanstalk takes care of the rest, from deployment details to <a id="_idIndexMarker2077"/>load balancing, scaling, and monitoring. You select the AWS EC2 hardware instances to deploy on.</p>
<p>Next, we will discuss another major player’s offering: <strong class="bold">Google </strong><strong class="bold">App Engine</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-294"><a id="_idTextAnchor312"/>Google App Engine</h2>
<p>Google’s PaaS solution is Google App Engine, a fully managed serverless environment that is relatively easy to use, with support for a large number of programming languages. Google App Engine is <a id="_idIndexMarker2078"/>a scalable solution with automatic security updates and managed infrastructure and monitoring. It offers solutions to connect to Google Cloud storage solutions and support for all major web programming languages such as Go, Node.js, Python, .NET, or Java. Google offers competitive pricing and an interface similar to the one we saw in their IaaS offering. Another major player with solid offerings is DigitalOcean, and we will discuss this next.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-295"><a id="_idTextAnchor313"/>DigitalOcean App Platform</h2>
<p>DigitalOcean offers a PaaS solution in the form of <strong class="bold">App Platform</strong>. It offers a straightforward interface, a direct<a id="_idIndexMarker2079"/> connection with your GitHub or GitLab repository, and a fully managed infrastructure. DigitalOcean is on the same level as big players such as Amazon and Google, and with App Platform, it manages infrastructure, provisioning, databases, application runtimes and dependencies, and the underlying operating system. It offers support for popular programming languages and frameworks such as Python, Node.js, Django, Go, React, and Ruby. DigitalOcean App Platform uses open cloud-native standards, with automatic code analysis, container creation, and orchestration. A distinctive competence of this solution is the free <em class="italic">starter tier</em>, for deploying up to three static websites. For prototyping dynamic web apps, there is a <em class="italic">basic tier</em>, and for <a id="_idIndexMarker2080"/>deploying professional apps on the market, there is a <em class="italic">professional tier</em> available. DigitalOcean’s interface is pleasant and could be attractive to newcomers. Their pricing acts as an advantage too.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-296"><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>Open source PaaS solutions</h2>
<p>Besides ready-to-use solutions<a id="_idIndexMarker2081"/> from providers listed previously, there are open source PaaS solutions provided by <strong class="bold">Cloud Foundry</strong>, <strong class="bold">Red Hat OpenShift</strong>, <strong class="bold">Heroku</strong>, and others, all of which we will not detail in this section. Nevertheless, the three mentioned previously are worth at least a short introduction, so let’s discuss them briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Red Hat OpenShift</strong>: This is a container platform for application deployments. Its base is a Linux distribution (RHEL) paired with a container runtime and solutions for networking, registry, authentication, and monitoring. OpenShift was designed to be a viable, hybrid<a id="_idIndexMarker2082"/> PaaS solution with total Kubernetes integration (Kubernetes will be covered briefly in the following section, <em class="italic">Introducing CaaS solutions</em>, and in more detail in <a href="B19682_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor342"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying Applications</em><em class="italic"> with Kubernetes</em>). OpenShift took advantage of the CoreOS acquisition (discussed later on) by providing some unique solutions. The new CoreOS Tectonic container platform is merging with OpenShift to bring to the user the best of both worlds.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Cloud Foundry</strong>: This is a cloud platform designed as an enterprise-ready PaaS solution. It is open source <a id="_idIndexMarker2083"/>and can be deployed on different infrastructures, from on-premises to IaaS providers such as Google GCP, Amazon AWS, Azure, or OpenStack. It offers various developer frameworks and a choice of Cloud Foundry certified platforms, such as Atos Cloud Foundry, IBM Cloud Foundry, SAP Cloud Platform, SUSE Cloud Application Platform, and VMware Tanzu.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Heroku</strong>: Heroku is a Salesforce company, and the platform was developed as an innovative PaaS. It is based<a id="_idIndexMarker2084"/> on a container system called Dynos, which uses Linux-based containers run by a<a id="_idIndexMarker2085"/> container management system, designed for scalability and agility. It offers fully managed data services with support for Postgres, Redis, Apache Kafka, and Heroku Runtime, a component responsible for container orchestration, scaling, and configuration management. Heroku also supports a plethora of programming languages, such as Node.js, Ruby, Python, Go, Scala, Clojure, and Java.</li>
</ul>
<p>PaaS has many solutions for developers, helping them create and deploy an application by taking away the burden of managing the infrastructure. As you might have learned by now, many of the solutions described in this section rely on the use of containers. This is why, in the next section, we will detail a subset of IaaS called CaaS, where we will introduce you to container orchestration and container-specialized operating systems.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-297"><a id="_idTextAnchor315"/>Introducing CaaS solutions</h1>
<p>CaaS is a subset of the IaaS cloud service model. It lets customers use individual containers, clusters, and applications on <a id="_idIndexMarker2086"/>top of a provider-managed infrastructure. CaaS can be used either on-premises or in the cloud, depending on the customer’s needs. In a CaaS model, the container engines and orchestration are provided and managed by the CSP. A user’s interaction with containers can be done either through an API or a web interface. The <a id="_idIndexMarker2087"/>container orchestration platform used by the provider—mainly <strong class="bold">Kubernetes</strong> and <strong class="bold">Docker</strong>—is important and is a key differentiator<a id="_idIndexMarker2088"/> between different solutions.</p>
<p>We covered containers (and VMs) in <a href="B19682_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor231"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Virtual Machines</em>, and<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B19682_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor257"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a><em class="italic">, Managing Containers with Docker</em>, without giving any detailed information about orchestration or container-specialized micro operating systems. We will now provide you with some more details on those subjects.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-298"><a id="_idTextAnchor316"/>Introducing the Kubernetes container orchestration solution</h2>
<p>Kubernetes is an open source project <a id="_idIndexMarker2089"/>developed by Google to be used <a id="_idIndexMarker2090"/>for the automatic deployment and scaling of containerized applications. It was written in the <strong class="bold">Go</strong> programming language. The name “Kubernetes” comes from Greek, and it refers to a ship’s helmsman or captain. Kubernetes is a tool for automating container management together with infrastructure abstraction and service monitoring.</p>
<p>Many newcomers confuse Kubernetes with Docker, or vice versa. They are complementary tools, each used for a specific purpose. Docker creates a container (like a box) in which you want to deploy your application, and Kubernetes takes care of the containers (or boxes) once the applications <a id="_idIndexMarker2091"/>are packed inside and deployed. Kubernetes provides a series of services that are essential to running containers, such as service discovery and load balancing, storage orchestration, automated backups and self-healing, and privacy. The Kubernetes architecture consists of several components that are crucial for any administrator to know. We will break them down for you in the next section.</p>
<h3>Introducing the Kubernetes components</h3>
<p>When you run Kubernetes, you mainly manage clusters of hosts, which are usually containers running Linux. In short, this means <a id="_idIndexMarker2092"/>that when you run Kubernetes, you run clusters. Here is a list of the basic components found in Kubernetes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong class="bold">cluster</strong> is the core of<a id="_idIndexMarker2093"/> Kubernetes, as its sole purpose is to manage lots of clusters. Each cluster consists of at least a control plane and one or more nodes, each node running containers inside pods.</li>
<li>A <strong class="bold">control plane</strong> consists of<a id="_idIndexMarker2094"/> processes that control nodes. The components of a control plane are as follows:<ul><li><strong class="bold">kube-apiserver</strong>: This is the API server at the frontend of the control plane</li><li><strong class="bold">etcd</strong>: This is the key-value store for all the data inside the cluster</li><li><strong class="bold">kube-scheduler</strong>: This looks for pods that have no assigned node and connects them to a node to run</li><li><strong class="bold">kube-controller-manager</strong>: This runs the controller processes, including the node controller, the replication controller, the endpoints controller, and the token controller</li><li><strong class="bold">cloud-controller-manager</strong>: This is a tool that allows you to link your cluster to your cloud provider’s API; it includes the node controller, the route controller, and the service controller</li></ul></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Nodes</strong> are either a VM or a physical machine running services needed for pods. The node components run on<a id="_idIndexMarker2095"/> every node and are responsible for maintaining the running pods. The components are as follows:<ul><li><strong class="bold">kube-proxy</strong>: This is responsible<a id="_idIndexMarker2096"/> for network rules on each node</li><li><strong class="bold">kubelet</strong>: This makes sure that each container is running inside a pod</li></ul></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Pods</strong> are a collection of <a id="_idIndexMarker2097"/>different containers running in the cluster. They are the components of the workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kubernetes clusters are extremely complicated to master. Understanding the concepts around it needs a lot of practice and dedication. No matter how complex it is, Kubernetes does not do everything for you. You still have to choose the container runtime (supported runtimes are <strong class="bold">Docker</strong>, <strong class="bold">containerd</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Container Runtime Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRI</strong>)-O), CI/CD tools, the storage<a id="_idIndexMarker2098"/> solution, access control, and app services.</p>
<p>Managing Kubernetes clusters is out of the scope of this chapter, but you will learn about this in <a href="B19682_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor342"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying Applications</em><em class="italic"> with Kubernetes</em>. This short introduction was needed for you to understand the concepts and tools that Kubernetes uses.</p>
<p>Besides Kubernetes, there are several other container orchestration tools, such as <strong class="bold">Docker Swarm</strong>, <strong class="bold">Apache Mesos</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Nomad</strong> from HashiCorp. They are extremely powerful tools, used by many people around the world. We will not cover these in detail here, but we thought it would be useful to at least enumerate them at the end of this container orchestration section. In the next section, we will provide you with some information about container solutions in the cloud.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-299"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Deploying containers in the cloud</h2>
<p>You can use<a id="_idIndexMarker2099"/> container orchestration solutions in the cloud, and the following offerings are essential for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Amazon Elastic Container Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">ECS</strong>): Amazon ECS is a fully managed service for orchestrating <a id="_idIndexMarker2100"/>containers. It offers an optional, serverless<a id="_idIndexMarker2101"/> solution (<strong class="bold">AWS Fargate</strong>) and is run inside by some of Amazon’s key services, which ensures that the tool is tested and is secure enough for anyone to use.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Amazon Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">EKS</strong>): Amazon also offers an EKS service for orchestrating Kubernetes <a id="_idIndexMarker2102"/>applications. It is based on <strong class="bold">Amazon EKS Distro</strong> (<strong class="bold">EKS-D</strong>), which is a Kubernetes distribution <a id="_idIndexMarker2103"/>developed by Amazon, based on the original open source Kubernetes. By using EKS-D, you can run Kubernetes either <a id="_idIndexMarker2104"/>on-premises, on Amazon’s own EC2 instances, or on VMware vSphere VMs.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Google Kubernetes Engine</strong> (<strong class="bold">GKE</strong>): GKE offers pre-built deployment templates, with pod auto-scaling based on the <a id="_idIndexMarker2105"/>CPU and memory usage. Scaling can be done across multiple pools, with enhanced security provided by GKE Sandbox. GKE Sandbox provides an extra layer of security by protecting the host kernel and running applications. Besides Google and Amazon, Microsoft offers a strong solution for container orchestration with AKS.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">AKS</strong>): AKS is a managed service for deploying clusters of containerized <a id="_idIndexMarker2106"/>applications. As with the other providers, Microsoft offers a fully managed solution by handling resource maintenance and health monitoring. The AKS nodes use Azure VMs to run and support different operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows Server images. It also offers free upgrades to the newest available Kubernetes images. Among other solutions, AKS offers GPU-enabled nodes, storage volume support, and special development tool integration with Microsoft’s own Visual Studio Code.</li>
</ul>
<p>After seeing some of the solutions available to deploy Kubernetes in the cloud and learning about the main components of Kubernetes and how they work, in the following section, we will discuss the importance of microservices in cloud computing.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-300"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>Introducing microservices</h2>
<p>A <strong class="bold">microservice</strong> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker2107"/>architectural style used in application delivery. Over time, application delivery evolved from a monolithic<a id="_idIndexMarker2108"/> model toward a decentralized one, all thanks to the evolution of cloud technologies. Starting with the historical launch of AWS in 2006, followed by the launch of Heroku in 2007 and Vagrant in 2010, application deployment started to change too, in order to take advantage of the new cloud offerings. Applications moved from having a single, large, and monolithic code base to a model where each application would benefit from different sets of services. This would make the code base more lightweight and dependent on different services.</p>
<p>Let us explain how a <strong class="bold">monolithic application</strong> differs from a <strong class="bold">microservices </strong><strong class="bold">architecture</strong> application:</p>
<ul>
<li>A monolithic application model has all the functionalities inside a single process and it is deployed by simple replication on multiple servers. In comparison, a microservice architecture <a id="_idIndexMarker2109"/>assumes that the application has its functionalities separated into different<a id="_idIndexMarker2110"/> services. Those services are then distributed and <a id="_idIndexMarker2111"/>scaled across different servers, depending on the user’s needs.</li>
<li>A microservices architecture has a modular-based approach. Each module will correspond to a specific service. Services work independently of one another and are connected through REST APIs based on the HTTP protocol. This means that each application functionality can be developed in different languages, depending on which one is better suited. This modular base can also take advantage of new container technologies.</li>
<li>A microservices architecture is known for rapidly delivering complex applications. It has no technology or language lock-in; it offers independent scaling and updates for each service and component, with no disturbance to other running services; and it has a fail-proof architecture. The microservices model can be adapted to existing monolithic applications by breaking them down into individual, modular services. There is no need to rewrite the entire application, only splitting the entire code <a id="_idIndexMarker2112"/>base into smaller parts. Microservices are optimized for DevOps and CI/CD practices, thanks to<a id="_idIndexMarker2113"/> their modular approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next section, we will introduce you to DevOps practices and tools.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>Introducing DevOps</h1>
<p><strong class="bold">DevOps</strong> is a culture. Its name comes from a combination of development and operations, and it envisions the <a id="_idIndexMarker2114"/>practices and tools that are used to deliver rapidly. DevOps is about speed, agility, and time. We all know the phrase “time is money,” and this applies very well to the IT sector. The ability to deliver services and applications at a high speed can make the difference between being successful as a business and being irrelevant in the market.</p>
<p>DevOps is a model of cooperation between different teams involved in delivering services and applications. This means that the entire life cycle, from development and testing, up to deployment and management, is done by teams that are equally involved at every stage. The DevOps model assumes that no team is operating in a closed environment, but rather operates transparently in order to achieve the agility they need to succeed. There is also a different DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker2115"/>model whereby security and quality assurance teams are equally involved in the development cycle. It is called <strong class="bold">DevSecOps</strong>.</p>
<p>Crucial for the DevOps model are the automated processes that are created using specific tools. This mindset of agility and speed determined the rise of a new name associated with DevOps, and that is CI/CD. The CI/CD mindset assures that every development step is continuous, with no interruptions. To support this mindset, new automation tools have emerged. Perhaps the most widely known is the open source automation tool, <strong class="bold">Jenkins</strong>. This is a modular <a id="_idIndexMarker2116"/>tool and can be extended with the use of plugins. The ecosystem around the application is quite large, with hundreds of plugins available to choose from. Jenkins is written in Java and was designed to automate software development processes, from building and testing, up to delivery. One of the assets of Jenkins is the ability to create a pipeline through the use of specialized plugins. A pipeline is a tool that adds support for CD as an automated process to the application life cycle. Jenkins can be used either on-premises or in the cloud. It is also a viable solution for use as a SaaS offering.</p>
<p>The DevOps philosophy is not only related to application deployment; healthy CD and CI are closely tied to the state of infrastructure. In this respect, tools for cloud management such as Ansible, Puppet, and Chef are extremely useful for managing the infrastructure that supports application<a id="_idIndexMarker2117"/> deployments. This is why configuration and management at the infrastructure level is extremely important. In the next section, you will learn about cloud infrastructure management.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>Exploring cloud management tools</h1>
<p>Today’s software development and deployment relies on a plethora of physical systems and VMs. Managing all the related<a id="_idIndexMarker2118"/> environments for development, testing, and production is a tedious task and involves the use of automated tools. The most widely used solutions for cloud infrastructure management are tools such as <strong class="bold">Ansible</strong>, <strong class="bold">Puppet</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Chef Infra</strong>. All these configuration management tools are powerful and reliable, and we will reserve <a href="B19682_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor359"><em class="italic">Chapter 17</em></a>, <em class="italic">Infrastructure and Automation with Ansible</em>, to teach you how to use only one of them: Ansible. Nevertheless, we will briefly introduce you to all of them in this section.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>Ansible</h2>
<p>Ansible is an open source project currently owned by Red Hat. It is considered a simple automation tool, used for diverse<a id="_idIndexMarker2119"/> actions such as application deployment, configuration management, cloud provisioning, and service orchestration. It was developed in Python <a id="_idIndexMarker2120"/>and uses the concept of nodes to define categories of systems, with a <strong class="bold">control node</strong> as the <a id="_idIndexMarker2121"/>master machine running Ansible, and <a id="_idIndexMarker2122"/>different <strong class="bold">managed nodes</strong> as other machines that are controlled by the master. All the nodes are connected over SSH and controlled through an <a id="_idIndexMarker2123"/>application called an <strong class="bold">Ansible module</strong>. Each module has a specific task to do on the managed nodes, and when the task is completed, it will be removed from that node.</p>
<p>The way modules are used is determined by an Ansible playbook. The playbook is written in <strong class="bold">YAML</strong> (a recursive<a id="_idIndexMarker2124"/> acronym for <strong class="bold">YAML Ain’t Markup Language</strong>), a language mostly used for configuration files. Ansible also uses the concept of <strong class="bold">inventory</strong>, where lists of the managed nodes are kept. When running commands on nodes, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker2125"/>apply them based on the lists inside your inventory, based on <strong class="bold">patterns</strong>. Ansible will apply the commands on every node or group of nodes available in a certain pattern. Ansible is considered one of the easiest automation tools available. It supports Linux/Unix and Windows for client machines, but the master machine must be Linux/Unix.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor322"/>Puppet</h2>
<p>Puppet is one of the oldest automation<a id="_idIndexMarker2126"/> tools available. Puppet’s architecture is different from that of Ansible. It uses <a id="_idIndexMarker2127"/>the concepts of <strong class="bold">primary servers</strong> and <strong class="bold">agents</strong>. Puppet works with infrastructure code written using <strong class="bold">domain-specific language</strong> (<strong class="bold">DSL</strong>) code specific to Puppet, based on the Ruby programming language. The code is <a id="_idIndexMarker2128"/>written on the primary server, transferred to the agent, and then translated into commands that are executed on the system you want to manage. Puppet also has an inventory tool called <strong class="bold">Facter</strong>, which stores <a id="_idIndexMarker2129"/>data about the agents, such as hostname, IP address, and operating system. Information stored is sent back to the primary server in the form of a <strong class="bold">manifest</strong>, which will then be transformed into a JSON document called a <strong class="bold">catalog</strong>. All the manifests<a id="_idIndexMarker2130"/> are kept inside <strong class="bold">modules</strong>, which are tools that are used for specific tasks. Each module contains information in the form of code and data. This data is centralized and <a id="_idIndexMarker2131"/>managed by a tool called <strong class="bold">Hiera</strong>. All the data<a id="_idIndexMarker2132"/> that Puppet generates is stored inside databases and managed through APIs by every app that needs to manage it. Compared to Ansible, Puppet seems a lot more complex. Puppet’s primary server supports only Linux/Unix.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-305"><a id="_idTextAnchor323"/>Chef Infra</h2>
<p>Chef Infra is another automation tool. It uses a client-server architecture. It uses the concepts of <strong class="bold">cookbooks</strong> and <strong class="bold">recipes</strong>. The main components are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Chef Server</strong>: This is similar to a hub <a id="_idIndexMarker2133"/>that handles all the configuration data. It is mainly used to upload <a id="_idIndexMarker2134"/>cookbooks to the Chef Client.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Chef Client</strong>: This is an application<a id="_idIndexMarker2135"/> that is installed on every node from the infrastructure that you manage.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Chef Workstation</strong>: The Chef Workstation manages cookbooks that are used for infrastructure administration.</li>

<p>Chef Infra uses the same Ruby-based code<a id="_idIndexMarker2136"/> similar to Puppet called DSL. The server needs to be installed on Linux/Unix, and the client supports Windows too.</p>
<p>All the automation and configuration tools presented in this section use different architectures but do the same thing, which is to provide an abstraction layer that defines the desired state of the infrastructure. Each tool is a different beast, having its own strengths and weaknesses. Chef Infra and Puppet might have a steeper learning curve with their Ruby/DSL-based code, while Ansible could be easier to approach due to its simpler architecture and use of the Python programming language. Nevertheless, you can’t go wrong with either one.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-306"><a id="_idTextAnchor324"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we introduced you to cloud computing by showing you some of the most important concepts, tools, and solutions used. This should be enough for you to start learning about cloud technologies, which is a very vast and complex subject. For more details, please refer to the <em class="italic">Further </em><em class="italic">reading</em> section.</p>
<p>We talked about cloud standards, a significant and largely overlooked subject, and about the main cloud types and services. You now have an idea of what each as-a-service solution means and what the main differences are between them. You know what the most important solutions are and how they are provided by the main players in this field: Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. We introduced you to container orchestration with Kubernetes and how it works. You learned about APIs and minimal container-specialized operating systems and the DevOps culture, microservices, and infrastructure automation tools. You learned a lot in this chapter, but keep in mind that all these subjects have only scratched the surface of cloud computing.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will introduce you to the more practical side of cloud deployments. You will learn how to deploy Linux on major clouds such as AWS, Azure, and GCP.</p>
