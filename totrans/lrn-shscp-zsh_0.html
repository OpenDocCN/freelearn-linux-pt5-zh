Be it because your job requires you to, or you simply love to poke around an operating system's internals, the shell is arguably how you deal with most of your activities.</p><p>Historically, shells were conceived for speeding up our work, but we all know that at some point, what was supposed to be a leaner way to get things done turned into a slugfest of arcane symbols and impossibly long-to-remember lines of code.</p><p>Wouldn't it be great then, if we could squeeze just a bit more out of our system? Imagine the things you are currently doing and being able to do them in a more efficient, elegant way, even the things that you thought were some sort of magic that only Linux's wizards with centuries' worth of experience were able to perform.</p><p>What if I told you that feats such as knowing which option flags are available to a program no longer require you to scan endless screens of manpages? Imagine not having to deal with journeys along infinite horizontal lines of characters anymore. And what about relying on automatic completion instead of typing the same lines again? What if knowing which directory you are currently working on merely required you to stare at your command prompt? Now imagine that all it takes for getting started with all of this only demands you to switch to a new shell.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>Before getting started, you should be comfortable in handling a terminal emulator. Most operating systems bundle such software within their stock set of applications, but as is the case with any application, there are other offerings out there waiting to be discovered. Such alternatives are probably even better suited for the task at hand, so please make sure you get to know the ins and outs of your weapon of choice and its quirks before jumping into this book.</p><p>Also required for following this text and the provided examples is the Git source code management system. It can be easily obtained and installed by following the instructions provided at <a class="ulink" href="http://git-scm.com">http://git-scm.com</a>, and it's an indispensable tool when attempting to use some of the various software projects and sources mentioned throughout this book.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is great for system administrators, developers, and other computer professionals involved with Unix, who are looking to improve on their daily tasks involving the Unix shell. It's assumed that you have some familiarity with a Unix command-line interface and feel comfortable with editors such as Emacs or vi. The usage of web browsers is optionally required for reading some online documentation.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text are shown as follows: "This alias changes the behavior of <code class="literal">ls</code> by calling it with the <code class="literal">color</code> flag every time you type it, instead of using its more vanilla version."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">zstyle ':completion:*:descriptions' format '%B%d%b'
zstyle ':completion:*:messages' format %d
zstyle ':completion:*:warnings' format 'No matches for: %d'</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">autoload <strong>-Uz</strong> compinit
<strong>compinit</strong>
</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>$ zsh --version</strong>
<strong>zsh 5.0.2 (x86_64-apple-darwin12.3.0)</strong>
</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Should your operating system greet you with a polite <strong>zsh not found</strong> message, that's ok though; otherwise, you won't be reading these lines."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
