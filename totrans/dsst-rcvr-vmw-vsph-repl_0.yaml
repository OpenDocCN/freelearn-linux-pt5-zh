  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you were to follow along with each chapter by practicing the tasks in a lab,
    then you would need two ESXi hosts, two vCenter Servers, two SRM instances, and
    two storage array nodes with replication configured between them. This might sound
    like a lot of hardware, but all you need is VMware Workstation 9.x or 10.x and
    a Virtual Storage Appliance such as HP Store Virtual 9500 (LeftHand networks).
    You could get a trial license for HP Store Virtual by registering for one at HP's
    website. The ESXi hosts, vCenter Servers, vSphere Replication Appliances, SRM
    Servers, and the storage nodes would be virtual machines that are hosted using
    VMware Workstation.

- en: This book is a guide for anyone who is keen on using vSphere Replication or
    vCenter Site Recovery Manager as a disaster recovery solution. This is an excellent
    handbook for solution architects, administrators, on-field engineers, and support
    professionals. Although the book assumes that the reader has some basic knowledge
    of data center virtualization using VMware vSphere, it can still be a very good
    reference for anyone who is new to virtualization.
