- en: BeagleBone Black inspires embedded hackers in different ways. Some see it as
    a controller board for a small robot, while others see it as a low-power, network
    server. In this book, we'll treat BeagleBone Black as a defender of personal security
    and privacy. Each chapter will discuss a technology and then provide a project
    to reinforce the concept.

- en: This book contains several independent projects that use various software packages
    and hardware components. All the software is open source, and installation instructions
    are given throughout the chapter. A list of all the necessary hardware is maintained
    as a SparkFun Electronics wish list at [https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/93119](https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/93119).
    Each chapter will list the required components for that project, so it's best
    to first read the chapter and then collect the necessary hardware.

- en: If you have an interest in individual security and privacy on the Internet,
    then you hopefully should enjoy this book. If you have a security background but
    are new to embedded computing, then you should find the projects challenging but
    rewarding. Conversely, if you are versed in electronics and are working with GNU/Linux
    distributions but haven't studied the security technologies mentioned in this
    book, then you should appreciate the discussions of the technologies in each chapter.
