While sizing a VDI incorrectly will cause a slow response time or poor end user experience, failing to build proper redundancy could render the solution unreachable. In a VDI solution there are physical failure points to consider such as network switches, power supplies, and hard drives. There are also software failure points such as the VMware vCenter Server, VMware View Connection Server, and the database server(s) to take into consideration.</p><p>This chapter analyzes the potential points of failure within a VDI and offers up suggestions to provide redundancy for each component.</p><div class="section" title="Physical infrastructure"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec01"/>Physical infrastructure</h1></div></div></div><p>In-depth coverage of designing a highly available virtual infrastructure is outside the scope of this book.

<span class="strong"><strong>VMware High Availability (HA)</strong></span> can be used to monitor and protect against physical host failures and can also be used to monitor and protect vDesktops themselves. VMware HA works by monitoring physical hosts in a given cluster. If a host is unable to communicate to the specific default gateway on a service console interface for 15 continuous seconds, an HA failover event is triggered. vSphere 5 also introduced Datastore Heartbeating, which is used when a network heartbeat failure has occurred. Datastore heartbeats provide an additional level of host isolation verification.<a id="id304" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>For more information on VMware HA, please refer to the<span class="emphasis"><em> HA Deepdive</em></span> article by Duncan Epping at<a class="ulink" href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/vmware-high-availability-deepdiv/"> http://www.yellow-bricks.com/vmware-high-availability-deepdiv/</a>. You can also check it in his book<span class="emphasis"><em> vSphere 5 Clustering Technical Deepdive</em></span>.</p><p>A host is determined to be isolated when a host has stopped receiving heartbeats from other hosts in the cluster and the specified isolation address cannot be pinged.<a id="id305" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>If the Isolation Response for the HA cluster is set to<span class="strong"><strong> Leave Power On</strong></span>, the vDesktops and other virtual machines on the host will remain powered on. Just because a host has lost network connectivity on its service console interface does not necessarily mean that the vDesktops have lost network connectivity.</p><p>If the Isolation Response for the HA cluster is set to<span class="strong"><strong> Power Off</strong></span>, the vDesktops and other virtual machines on the host will be powered off. This setting avoids the possibility of a split-brain scenario.<a id="id306" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>With the advancements in vSphere 5, the host isolation events are highly verified and accurate and very likely indicate an actual host problem. Therefore, in VMware View solutions, it's preferred to set the Isolation Response to<span class="strong"><strong> Power Off</strong></span>.</p><p>If a specific host containing vDesktops has been isolated from the cluster, it will perform the following:<a id="id307" class="indexterm"/>

</p><p>VMware HA works by determining the slot size, or minimum amount of CPU and memory to support a failover of the most intensive virtual machine (or vDesktop).</p><p>For example, if vDesktop_A has 4 GHz of CPU and 2 GB of RAM while vDesktop_B has 1 GHz of CPU and 6 GB of RAM, the slot size will be 4 GHz of CPU and 6 GB of RAM (with additional calculations taken into consideration for memory overheard).</p><p>In VMware View environments, there will likely be large quantities of vDesktops with identical specifications (for example, a Windows XP vDesktop with 2 GHz of CPU and 2 GB of RAM), therefore a concept known as<span class="strong"><strong> slot fragmentation</strong></span> is primarily avoided. Slot fragmentation requires the collective availability of sufficient resources in a cluster to support virtual machines being powered on during an HA event, but the lack of sufficient resources on an individual physical host to support a virtual machine's requirements.<a id="id310" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>For more information on slot fragmentation, please see Duncan Epping's very thorough article at the same URL:<a class="ulink" href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/vmware-high-availability-deepdiv/"> http://www.yellow-bricks.com/vmware-high-availability-deepdiv/</a>, as mentioned earlier.<a id="id311" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_02.jpg" alt="Do you even need VMware HA?"/></div><p>As of vSphere 4.1, HA also works in conjunction with DRS to free resource slots should slot fragmentation occur within a cluster. This would involve a failed server having to wait for virtual machines to be vMotion'd across hosts in the cluster until enough slots exist to power on necessary virtual machine(s).</p><p>With a VMware View solution based on persistent vDesktops, HA should be used.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_03.jpg" alt="Do you even need VMware HA?"/></div><p>In the preceding diagram, the end user is connected to a vDesktop on Host1. Both Host1 and Host2 are part of the same cluster and can see the same shared storage. As illustrated in the diagram, the actual virtual disk files for the vDesktop reside on the shared storage and not on local storage within Host1.<a id="id312" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_04.jpg" alt="Do you even need VMware HA?"/></div><p>As illustrated in the preceding diagram, when Host1 fails, the end user is disconnected from the vDesktop.

In this case, the vDesktop is unavailable as it resides on Host1, which has just failed.<a id="id313" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The end user will be unable to work until the vDesktop is back online or the end user is manually assigned to another (available) vDesktop resource.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_05.jpg" alt="Do you even need VMware HA?"/></div><p>As illustrated in the preceding diagram, VMware HA has powered the end user's vDesktop up on Host2, an available host in the cluster. By default, there is no notification to the end user that his/her vDesktop is now available, so the end user will need to try repeatedly for the time it takes vDesktop to come online on Host2. This typically takes between 1 and 3 minutes.<a id="id314" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note19"/>Note</h3><p>An advanced solution concept for persistent vDesktop environments is to monitor for individual vDesktop outages. If a user's persistent vDesktop is determined to be offline, an e-mail can be sent to the end user (who would likely receive it on his/her mobile device) letting him/her know that his/her vDesktop is currently unavailable but that the resolution is in progress. The same concept can then be used to detect when the vDesktop is back online and available (for example, by adding a 2 minute wait when a vDesktop enters the VMware Tool's OK state) and then notify the user that his/her vDesktop is now available.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_06.jpg" alt="Do you even need VMware HA?"/></div><p>For solutions using non-persistent vDesktops, the use of VMware HA is the topic of greater debate. While non-persistent solutions rely on a pool of vDesktops spread across multiple hosts in a cluster, end users are not assigned to an individual vDesktop. When a host fails in a non-persistent solution, any end users connected to vDesktops on that specific host lose their connectivity. The end users can then reconnect to the VMware View environment, and, as long as another vDesktop is available, that user will successfully connect to a resource. This is because vDesktop assignment is done randomly at the time of log in when using non-persistent vDesktops.<a id="id315" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="section" title="Non-persistent example"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl4sec01"/>Non-persistent example</h4></div></div></div><p>For this example, Company_A has 60 end users and has created a non-persistent vDesktop pool with the following settings:<a id="id316" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Numbers of end users = 60</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Desktop pool size (maximum number of desktops) = 60</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Number of spare (powered on) desktops = 0</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Power setting = Always On</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Provision all desktops up front</li></ul></div><p>With these settings, when the pool is initially built, it will automatically provision 60 vDesktops and power them on.<a id="id317" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The count is authoritatively held by VMware View in the ADAM database. If the pool's power settings are set to<span class="strong"><strong> Always On</strong></span>, VMware View will create a pool of 60 vDesktops and immediately power all of them on. No matter what load exists from the end user community, 60 vDesktops will always be powered on. If 61 end users try to log in concurrently, 1 end user will be unable to access a resource.</p><p>Imagine a scenario where Host1 hosts 30 vDesktops and Host2 hosts 30 vDesktops. The desktop pool is configured to host 60 vDesktops.</p><p>In this environment, if Host1 suddenly fails, the 30 vDesktops being hosted on Host1 enter an "Agent Unreachable" state. While the VMware View Connection Server has recognized that there are now 30 vDesktops that are unreachable, it does not provision 30 new vDesktops on the available hosts in the cluster (for example, Host2).</p><p>Therefore, without using HA to restart the vDesktops on another host, the pool's total number of vDesktops will be reduced. By using VMware HA, the pool's total number of vDesktops will not be reduced, although there could be a decrease in overall performance (if the ability to exceed available resources is allowed).</p><p>There are two design paths for non-persistent vDesktop solutions. The first is to simply use VMware HA to ensure that any vDesktops that reside on a failed host are restarted on another available host in the cluster. This is likely the easiest configuration and results in 5 10 minutes of downtime (as vDesktops power up and enter a useable state).</p><p>The second design path is to design the desktop pool(s) with enough vDesktops to sustain a host failure. It is important to ensure that the number of used vDesktops does not exceed the legally licensed amount from VMware. However, by building a desktop pool with additional capacity (for example, extra 30 vDesktops), and outage of one host has minimal impact on the end user environment. For those users that were connected to a vDesktop on the failed host, they simply log back into the VMware View environment and connect to one of the already provisioned, already available, extra vDesktops.

As will be covered later in this book, local storage is a viable option for certain VDI solutions. If the end user's vDesktop resides on local storage to Host1, during a host failure VMware HA would not be able to bring the vDesktop up on another host (for example, Host2) as other hosts would not have access to the virtual disk files residing on the local storage on Host1.<a id="id319" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_08.jpg" alt="Using local storage"/></div><p>As illustrated in the preceding diagram, both Host1 and Host2 have a local<span class="strong"><strong> Virtual Machine File System (VMFS)</strong></span> data store as well as access to a shared VMFS data store on the<span class="strong"><strong> Storage Area Network (SAN)</strong></span>. If Host1 has an outage, any vDesktops or templates that were stored on the local VMFS data store on Host1 would be unavailable.<a id="id320" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>If a persistent solution was in use and vDesktops were placed on the local VMFS data store, end users would not have access to their vDesktops during a host outage. VMware HA would not matter as the vDesktops were not on shared storage, but instead on the local VMFS data store of the host.</p><p>Therefore, it is imperative to use a non-persistent solution when placing core virtual disks of a vDesktop on local storage as end users are not specifically assigned to a unique vDesktop. If the physical server hosting vDesktop_17 a persistent vDesktop assigned to employee User_LL were to fail, User_LL would not be able to connect to a desktop resource.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="VMware Distributed Resource Scheduling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec02"/>VMware Distributed Resource Scheduling</h2></div></div></div><p>While<span class="strong"><strong> VMware Distributed Resource Scheduling (DRS)</strong></span> does not provide resilience, it does minimize the potential impact during an unpredicted physical host failure. By balancing the processing load across all of the available hosts in a cluster, a host failure will have approximately the minimum impact possible. This is true for both virtual machines running a server OS and vDesktops. In a VMware View solution with virtualized VMware vCenter Server(s) and/or VMware View Connection Server(s), it is prudent to use VMware DRS to balance the load in the cluster and minimize the impact. For additional considerations, please refer to the<span class="emphasis"><em> Anti-affinity</em></span> section explained next.<a id="id321" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_09.jpg" alt="VMware Distributed Resource Scheduling"/></div><p>In the example given in the preceding diagram, there are three hosts in a cluster without VMware DRS enabled. On the first host in the cluster, there are 70 vDesktops. On the second one, there are 10 vDesktops, and on the third host, there are 20 vDesktops. As VMware DRS is not enabled, the load (and therefore the number of vDesktops) is not balanced across all of the available hosts in the cluster.<a id="id322" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_10.jpg" alt="VMware Distributed Resource Scheduling"/></div><p>Continuing the example, if the first host were to have an unpredicted outage, 70 vDesktops would be impacted. If DRS was enabled and all vDesktops had roughly the same CPU consumption, approximately 34 vDesktops would be placed on each host. This will drastically reduce the number of end users that would experience an outage should a physical host fail.<a id="id323" class="indexterm"/>

<span class="strong"><strong>Affinity</strong></span> and<span class="strong"><strong> Anti-affinity</strong></span> are settings within VMware DRS that determine how virtual machines in a given cluster react to one another.<a id="id324" class="indexterm"/>

There are no affinity or anti-affinity rules set. The VMware View solution requires two View Connection Servers, both of which have been virtualized and placed in the aforementioned cluster.<a id="id325" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Through normal DRS activities, both View Connection Servers find themselves on Host1.

</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_14.jpg" alt="Load balancing"/></div><p>Therefore, it is important to protect the available View Connection Server(s) in the VDI. It is best practice to have a minimum of two VMware View Connection Server(s) (or potentially one protected by VMware Fault Tolerance). The easiest way to accomplish resilience for the VMware View Connection Servers is to use a load balancing solution. There are various load balancing solutions available, including<span class="strong"><strong> Microsoft Network Load Balancer (NLB)</strong></span> and hardware appliances from companies like F5 (preferred).<a id="id342" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>A load balancing solution will create a virtual IP address that will be used by end users to connect to the VDI. Behind the virtual IP address will be the actual IP addresses of all of the VMware View Connection Servers in the load balancing pool.

</p><p>VMware FT takes inputs and events that occur on the primary VM and transfer them to the secondary VM, which is running on a separate host in the cluster.</p><p>VMware FT does impact the virtual infrastructure design, as it requires a separate and dedicated NIC for FT Logging. The FT Logging and vMotion NICs must reside on separate subnets. Also, no more than four VMware FT-enabled virtual machine primaries or secondaries can reside on any single ESX host.</p><div class="section" title="Design impact when using VMware FT"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl3sec04"/>Design impact when using VMware FT</h3></div></div></div><p>To properly illustrate the design impact of using VMware FT, the following example will be used.<a id="id346" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Through a thorough analysis, it has been determined that CustomerA requires four VMware View Connection Servers to satisfy the demand of incoming requests.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_15.jpg" alt="Design impact when using VMware FT"/></div><p>As part of the solution, four VMware View Connection Servers are installed and configured, and placed behind a load balancer.<a id="id347" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_16.jpg" alt="Design impact when using VMware FT"/></div><p>If a VMware View Connection Server has a critical fault (for example, Blue Screen of Death), only three connection servers are available to the end users. There is a possibility that the three remaining connection servers cannot handle the load and some end users are unable to connect to the VDI.<a id="id348" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_17.jpg" alt="Design impact when using VMware FT"/></div><p>The only way to restore connectivity for a failed View Connection Server that's had a critical fault is to either restore from a previous backup or build a new View Connection Server, and add it to the load balanced pool, as illustrated in the preceding diagram.<a id="id349" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>If a VMware View Connection Server resides on a host that has a failure, VMware HA will power the virtual machine up on an available host in the cluster. There may be several minutes of downtime for some end users (if the remaining three View Connection Servers are unable to handle the load). However, after 3 to 5 minutes, full connectivity should be restored.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_18.jpg" alt="Design impact when using VMware FT"/></div><p>By leveraging VMware FT to protect the View Connection Servers, there will be zero impact should a physical host failure occur in this solution (assuming anti-affinity has separated primary and secondary VMs).<a id="id350" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_19.jpg" alt="Design impact when using VMware FT"/></div><p>In the event of a physical host failure that impacts a View Connection Server, VMware FT immediately makes the secondary (shown in bottom row in the preceding diagram) active. Through technology from VMware vLockstep, the secondary is an identical copy of the primary that resided on the failed host. Once the failover has successfully occurred, the secondary is now marked as the primary. In addition, a new secondary is spawned from the newly appointed primary.<a id="id351" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title"><a id="note21"/>Note</h3><p>However, VMware FT does not protect against guest operating system failures (for example, Blue Screen of Death). Therefore, coupling VMware FT with VM Monitoring via VMware HA is the most robust solution possible.</p></div><p>While VMware FT is a useful technology in protecting VMware View Connection Servers, most virtualization architects would prefer to simply add an additional View Connection Server to the original design instead of adding the complexity of VMware FT.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Parent vDesktop and templates"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec04"/>Parent vDesktop and templates</h1></div></div></div><p>Virtual machine templates are used by VMware View when deploying vDesktops with the<span class="strong"><strong> full virtual machine</strong></span> option selected. Standard virtual machines (not templates) are used by VMware View when deploying vDesktops with the<span class="strong"><strong> View Composer linked clones</strong></span> option selected. For a virtual machine to be seen by View Composer, it must have at least one snapshot. View Composer deploys all vDesktops in the pool from the selected snapshot.<a id="id352" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>It is important to understand that if the parent vDesktop (for Linked Clone pools) or the gold vDesktop template (for Full Desktop pools) are not available, then new vDesktops cannot be provisioned.<a id="id353" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="section" title="Templates"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec07"/>Templates</h2></div></div></div><p>Virtual machine templates are a bit confusing to protect. When creating a virtual machine template or adding a virtual machine template to the inventory, the administrator must select a specific host within a cluster. According to the<span class="strong"><strong> graphical user interface (GUI)</strong></span>, "Choose a specific host within the cluster. On high-availability clusters and fully-manual dynamic workload management clusters, each template must be assigned to a specific host."<a id="id354" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Therefore, if the gold template for vDesktops resides on Host1 and if Host1 experiences a failure, VMware HA will not recover this template. Instead, the original template will be shown as unavailable within vCenter. From this point, the original inventory entry in vCenter for the template can be removed and then the template can be re-added. This is possible because while the host is unavailable, the virtual machine template actually resides on shared storage (assuming that best practice was followed).</p><p>When assisting an organization with operational readiness, the preceding recovery process should be listed in a Standard Operating Procedure manual.</p></div><div class="section" title="Parent vDesktops with snapshots"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec08"/>Parent vDesktops with snapshots</h2></div></div></div><p>To protect the parent vDesktop and its snapshot, a simple clone virtual machine task will not suffice. This is because the clone task consolidates the snapshot tree and thus removes all snapshots associated with the base virtual machine.<a id="id355" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/1124EN_07_20.jpg" alt="Parent vDesktops with snapshots"/></div><p>Therefore, it is imperative that VMware HA should be used to protect the parent vDesktop. As the parent vDesktop is simply a virtual machine with snapshots (as opposed to a virtual machine template in the preceding scenario), VMware HA will change the ownership of the parent vDesktop to an available host in the cluster during a host outage.<a id="id356" class="indexterm"/>

<div class="section" title="User personas"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec05"/>User personas</h1></div></div></div><p>For environments that leverage a user persona solution, such as Liquidware Labs ProfileUnity™, placing the user personas on a highly available network share is critical to ensure end user data is always available. By using the<span class="strong"><strong> Distributed File System (DFS)</strong></span> service or<span class="strong"><strong> Distributed File System Replication (DFS-R)</strong></span> service, a file share storing user personas will still be available in the event of a file server failure. In addition, with DFS-R, user personas can be replicated to other servers in the same site or other sites. DFS-R enables a VDI to provide<span class="strong"><strong> Continuity of Operations (COOP)</strong></span> by ensuring that the file share containing the user personas has its data replicated offsite.<a id="id357" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Microsoft DFS also leverages Active Directory sites to ensure that an end user is retrieving their persona from the nearest server participating in the DFS/DFS-R group. In addition, site costing­ can be used to state which is the least expensive target selection for end users attempting to retrieve their user persona from a network share.<a id="id358" class="indexterm"/>

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec06"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Thus far, some of the most important design considerations (for example, persistent or non-persistent) have been addressed, as well as proper sizing of the overall VDI. Designing a VMware View solution that is highly resilient is also paramount to a production-quality solution. In the next chapter, the last major hurdle, storage design, will be discussed. An improperly sized VDI can result in a poor end user experience. A VDI without redundancy can result in unexpected outages and downtime. A VDI with improperly designed storage can not only result in poor end user experience but also significantly add to the overall cost of the VDI solution. As storage is often one of the expensive components, (if not the most expensive component) of a VDI solution, judicious sizing that will still meet the requirements is key.</p></div></body></html>
