- en: Before starting the installation of VMware Workstation, you should take care
    of the host computer on which you want to use VMware Workstation. Sure, any computer
    that meets the minimal requirements will work, but if you choose the appropriate
    configuration, you'll benefit more from your VMware Workstation installation.
    In this section, we'll spend a few words on using the most appropriate configuration
    for your computer.

- en: Every virtual machine that you'll install will work as a computer by itself,
    and the total number of CPU cores in your computer will be available as the maximum
    number of CPUs that you'll allocate to a virtual machine. However, if you want
    to get the best performance out of your virtual machines, it is a good idea to
    not configure more virtual CPUs than the total number of CPUs and CPU cores in
    your computer. This means that if you have four cores in total, ideally you shouldn't
    run more than three virtual machines with one core each at the same time. As the
    number of virtual CPUs that are in use gets higher than the total number of CPUs
    in your computer, CPUs must be shared, and that is not good for performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no formal number of CPU cores, so if you're on a budget for hardware,
    you can run VMware Workstation on a computer that has only one core. However for
    best possible performance, this is not recommended.

    you can define groups of resources that make sure that every VM always has a dedicated
    amount of system resources available; a nice and efficient way to use the hardware
    in the best and most optimal way.

- en: If a computer runs out of physical RAM, it starts swapping to disk. Using VMware
    Workstation, you want to avoid your computer starting to swap at all times. To
    make sure this never happens, the total size of RAM in your computer must be more
    than the total amount of RAM in use by all the virtual machines, with an addition
    of 2 GB for the host operating system for smooth operation. This means that a
    typical computer that is going to be used for VMware Workstation will have at
    least 4 GB of RAM or more if possible. But if you're on a budget and want to create
    virtual machines that don't need much RAM, you can work with VMware Workstation
    on a minimal 1 GB of RAM.

- en: A very important part of the configuration of the host system is the available
    disk space. Typically, each virtual machine needs a couple of gigabytes of available
    disk space; so a minimal configuration will need at least 10 GB of available disk
    space, whereas on a dedicated test machine that is going to run several virtual
    machines, you might need hundreds of gigabytes of free disk space.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're looking for good performance, just having the available disk space
    is not enough. This is because you don't want the virtual machine disk file to
    be fragmented. To avoid fragmentation, it is recommended that you use a machine
    where a separate disk is dedicated to the storage of VMDK files. The benefit of
    this that you can avoid fragmentation, and you'll have one disk that is dedicated
    to the operating system and another disk that is dedicated to handling virtual
    machine I/O requests.

    VMware offers basic support that is 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday or business
    support that is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. When purchasing support, you can
    select a contract period of either one year or three years. If support is important
    for you, I recommend that you buy Production support. The price difference is
    small, and for this small difference you will have 24/7 support.

    amount of RAM that you'll make available for the use of the virtual machines.
    On one hand, you need to make sure that there is enough RAM remaining to keep
    the host operating system running smoothly. On the other hand, you also want to
    make sure that you have enough RAM to allocate the needs of all of your virtual
    machines. If you don't have sufficient RAM for the host operating system, it will
    start swapping, and if you don't have enough RAM for the virtual machines, the
    virtual machine memory will get swapped, neither of which is good for the performance
    of your computer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also under **Memory**, you can specify how the swap is going to be used. The
    best option for good performance is to disallow the usage of the swap completely.
    To do this select **Fit all virtual memory into reserved host RAM**, but this
    means that you might not be able to run all the virtual machines that you need
    on your host computer. The default option, which is selected, is **Allow some
    virtual machine memory to be swapped**. This offers the best compromise between
    performance and the amount of virtual machines that you can run. If you want to
    be able to run as many virtual machines as possible on the available hardware
    at the host computer, select **Allow most virtual machine memory to be swapped**;
    but be prepared for bad performance if you plan to run multiple virtual machines
    on your computer.

    machines are in use, make sure that the **Input ungrabbed** option reads **Low**.

    default options will run the snapshot process in the background irrespective of
    whether you are taking a snapshot or restoring a snapshot. However, running snapshots
    in the background ensures that changes are only applied when the virtual machine
    is off. If you want to apply changes directly, you will need to make sure that
    the snapshot program runs as a foreground job. This will, however, slow down other
    processes on your computer as the snapshot process is both heavy in I/O as well
    as in CPU usage.
