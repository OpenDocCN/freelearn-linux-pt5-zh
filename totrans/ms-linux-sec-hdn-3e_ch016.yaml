    still true that Linux users don’t have to worry about viruses, there are other
    types of malware that can definitely ruin a Linux user’s day. Cryptomining programs
    planted on your server can eat up memory and CPU cycles, causing your server to
    work much harder and use more power than it should. Ransomware, which can encrypt
    either important files or a system’s bootloader, can make these important files
    or even the whole system inaccessible. Even paying the demanded ransom isn’t always
    a guarantee that your system will be returned to proper order. One way to prevent
    these programs from doing their damage is to only allow authorized programs to
    run, and to block everything else. We have two ways of doing that, which are the
    topics of this chapter:'

    or compile one yourself, then yeah, you will have to manually add it to the trusted
    list. But, by default, every program that gets installed by the system package
    manager is automatically trusted. That means that if you use either `dnf` to install
    a package from the repository, or `rpm` to install an `rpm` package that you either
    downloaded or created, then the associated application is automatically trusted.

    you’ve seen enough to get the gist of it. To get more details about it and to
    see how to also use it as a file-integrity checker, be sure to visit the official
    Red Hat documentation for it. (The link is below in the *Further reading* section.)

- en: Adding the `noexec`, `nosuid`, and `nodev` mount options to your partitions
    works well, except that you can’t add them to all of your partitions. Obviously,
    you can’t add them to any partitions that are supposed to have executable files
    in them, or else your system would never work. The `fapolicyd` framework gives
    you a way to prevent rogue programs from running on those partitions, as long
    as the malicious intruder hasn’t already gained root privileges.

- en: In this chapter, we looked at two ways to prevent untrusted programs from running
    on your systems. The first method, which can be used on any Linux distro, is to
    separate the various system and data directories into their own separate partitions,
    and then to mount each of these partitions with the appropriate combination of
    the `noexec`, `nosuid`, and `nodev` options. The second method, which so far is
    only available on Red Hat and its clones, is to use the `fapolicyd` framework.
    We saw how to automatically enable both of these methods by applying the STIG
    OpenSCAP profile as we install the operating system. Finally, we saw how to install
    `fapolicyd` separately, without having to apply the STIG profile.
