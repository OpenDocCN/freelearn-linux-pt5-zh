- en: This section will touch upon the IIO framework, pin control and GPIO systems,
    and other important feature-rich concepts. In this section, you will also gain
    an in-depth understanding of GPIOs mapped to interrupts and their processing mechanisms,
    describing every kernel data structure and API involved. Finally, youâ€™ll learn
    how to deal with input devices drivers. It goes without saying that user-space
    handlings of the enumerated subsystems will be introduced in this section as well.
